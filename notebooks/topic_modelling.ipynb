       "Hundreds of people have been forced to vacate their homes in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales as strong winds today pushed a huge bushfire towards the town of Hill Top. A new blaze near Goulburn, south-west of Sydney, has forced the closure of the Hume Highway. At about 4:00pm AEDT, a marked deterioration in the weather as a storm cell moved east across the Blue Mountains forced authorities to make a decision to evacuate people from homes in outlying streets at Hill Top in the New South Wales southern highlands. An estimated 500 residents have left their homes for nearby Mittagong. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service says the weather conditions which caused the fire to burn in a finger formation have now eased and about 60 fire units in and around Hill Top are optimistic of defending all properties. As more than 100 blazes burn on New Year's Eve in New South Wales, fire crews have been called to new fire at Gunning, south of Goulburn. While few details are available at this stage, fire authorities says it has closed the Hume Highway in both directions. Meanwhile, a new fire in Sydney's west is no longer threatening properties in the Cranebrook area. Rain has fallen in some parts of the Illawarra, Sydney, the Hunter Valley and the north coast. But the Bureau of Meteorology's Claire Richards says the rain has done little to ease any of the hundred fires still burning across the state. \"The falls have been quite isolated in those areas and generally the falls have been less than about five millimetres,\" she said. \"In some places really not significant at all, less than a millimetre, so there hasn't been much relief as far as rain is concerned. \"In fact, they've probably hampered the efforts of the firefighters more because of the wind gusts that are associated with those thunderstorms.\" \n",
       "Indian security forces have shot dead eight suspected militants in a night-long encounter in southern Kashmir. The shootout took place at Dora village some 50 kilometers south of the Kashmiri summer capital Srinagar. The deaths came as Pakistani police arrested more than two dozen militants from extremist groups accused of staging an attack on India's parliament. India has accused Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad of carrying out the attack on December 13 at the behest of Pakistani military intelligence. Military tensions have soared since the raid, with both sides massing troops along their border and trading tit-for-tat diplomatic sanctions. Yesterday, Pakistan announced it had arrested Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed. Police in Karachi say it is likely more raids will be launched against the two groups as well as other militant organisations accused of targetting India. Military tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated to a level not seen since their 1971 war. \n",
       "The national road toll for the Christmas-New Year holiday period stands at 45, eight fewer than for the same time last year. 20 people have died on New South Wales roads, with eight fatalities in both Queensland and Victoria.

       "Argentina's political and economic crisis has deepened with the resignation of its interim President who took office just a week ago. Aldolfo Rodregiuez Saa told a stunned nation that he could not rescue Argentina because key fellow Peronists would not support his default on massive foreign debt repayment or his plan for a new currency. It was only a week ago that he was promising a million new jobs to end four years of recession, days after his predecessor resigned following a series of failed rescue packages. After announcing that the senate leader, Ramon Puerta, would assume the presidency until congress appoints a new caretaker president, the government said he too had quit and another senior lawmaker would act in the role. Fresh elections are not scheduled until March leaving whoever assumes the presidency with the daunting task of tackling Argentina's worst crisis in 12 years, but this time, isolated by international lending agencies. \n",
       "Six midwives have been suspended at Wollongong Hospital, south of Sydney, for inappropriate use of nitrous oxide during work hours, on some occasions while women were in labour. The Illawarra Area Health Service says that following an investigation of unprofessional conduct, a further four midwives have been relocated to other areas within the hospital. The service's chief executive officer, Tony Sherbon, says no one was put at risk, because other staff not involved in the use of nitrous oxide were able to take over caring for women in labour. \"Well we're very concerned and the body of midwives to the hospital - there are over 70 midwives that work in our service - are very annoyed and angry at the inappropriate behaviour of these very senior people who should know better,\" he said. \"And that's why we've take the action of suspending them and we'll consider further action next week.\" \n",
       "The Federal Government says it should be safe for Afghani asylum seekers in Australia to return home when the environment becomes secure. The Government has suspended their applications while the interim government is established in Kabul. The Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer has refused to say for how long the claims process has been put on hold. But he says the major threat to most people seeking asylum is no longer there. \"Many Afghans who have tried to get into Australia or for that matter into Britain and other countries in north-west Europe have claimed that they are fleeing the Taliban,\" he said. \"Well, the Taliban is no longer in power in Afghanistan, the Taliban is finished.\" Meanwhile, there has been a mass airlift of detainees from Christmas Island to the Pacific Island of Nauru. In total, more than 300 people have been flown from the island in two operations using chartered aircraft. The second airlift today delivered 180 asylum seekers to Nauru where they will await processing of their claims for temporary visas. The Department of Immigration says there are now 211 detainees remaining on Christmas Island. A spokesman says a decision regarding their future is yet to be made. \n",
       "The United States team of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill scored a decisive victory over unseeded France in their first Hopman Cup match at Burswood Dome in Perth. The pair, runners-up in the $1 million dollar mixed teams event last year, both won their singles encounters to give the US an unbeatable 2-0 lead. The 28-year-old Seles, currently ranked eighth, recovered from a shaky start to overpower Virginie Razzano, 18, who is ranked 72nd. Seles had to fight hard to get home in straight sets, winning 6-3, 6-4 in 62 minutes. Then the 24-year-old Gambill (ranked 21st) wore down a determined Arnaud Clement, 24, (18th) to win 6-4, 6-4 in 91 minutes. The Americans are aiming to go one better than last year when they were beaten by Swiss pair Martina Hingis and Roger Federer in the final of the eight-nation contest. Gambill said the win was a great way to start the tennis year. \"I got a little tentative at the end, but it was a great start to my year,\" he said. \"Arnaud is a great scrapper and I am delighted to beat him, even though I am frankly a bit out of shape. \"That is one of the reasons I am here. I will be in shape by the end of the tournament. \"I just aim to keep improving in the new year, and if I do, I think I have a chance to beat anyone when I am playing well.\" Gambill was pressed hard by Clement before taking the first set in 47 minutes. But the American gained the ascendancy in the second set, breaking in the third and fifth games. Seles said she had expected her clash with Razzano to be tough. \"She was a top junior player in the world, so it was no surprise that she fought so well,\" she said. Seles said she still had the hunger to strive to regain her position at the top of her sport. \"This is why you play,\" she said. \"But I want to try not to peak too early this season. \"Seles, slow into her stride, slipped to 2-3 in her opening set against Razzano but recovered quickly, claiming the set after snatching four games in a row. In the second set, Seles broke her opponent in the opening game and completed victory with relative ease despite Razzano's tenacious efforts. \n",
       "Hundreds of canoeists are enjoying hard-earned New Years Eve celebrations following five days paddling in the Murray River Marathon. After more than 400 exhausting kilometres battling hot and dusty conditions, a Melbourne team took out the strongly contested K-one Cup this afternoon. Two hundred and thirty canoes left Yarrawonga last Thursday, with just over 200 paddling across the finishing line at Swan Hill. The others fell victim to the gruelling conditions. The event raised about $170,000 for the Red Cross. \n",
       "There has been welcome relief for firefighters in New South Wales overnight with milder weather allowing them to strengthen containment lines around the most severe fires. But fire authorities are not getting overly optimistic as dry and hot weather is forecast to continue. The weather bureau is forecasting temperatures in the high 30s and westerly winds until at least Friday, which means fire authorities are reluctant to get too excited about last night's favourable conditions. Marks Sullivan from the Rural Fire Service says fire fighters are remaining on guard. \"A lot of fires that have been burning in the areas around Sydney and the north coast and further south have been burning within areas that are known and are contained,\" he said. \"However, that's not to say that these fires won't pose a threat given the weather conditions that are coming up over the next few days.\" Despite the caution, the Rural Fire Service says most of the state's fires that threaten property are burning within containment lines. Greater Sydney is ringed by fires to the north, west and south. Two of those flared overnight. One at Appin in the southern highlands was quickly brought under control. Another flare-up at Spencer, north of the city, is not contained on its north-western flank, but is not threatening property. In the lower Blue Mountains west of Sydney, firefighters have spent the night setting up a 20 kilometre containment line to protect communities along the Great Western Highway from Glenbrook to Bulaburra. Two fires burning near Cessnock, west of Newcastle, are still within containment lines. In the state's north, aircraft will this morning check if lightning from a large electrical storm overnight has sparked any new fires above Grafton. Aircraft have also been used in the Shoalhaven area in the state's south to drop incendiary devices that start fire control lines in inaccessible areas. The Rural Fire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg says if fire activity increases hundreds of New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations in New South Wales will be cancelled. \n",
       "Some roads are closed because of dangerous conditions caused by bushfire smoke. Motorists are being asked to avoid the Hume Highway between Picton Road and the Illawarra Highway, where police have reduced the speed limit from 110 kilometres an hour to 80. In southern Sydney, Picton Road is closed between Wilton and Bulli, Appin Road is closed from Appin to Bulli Tops, and all access roads to Royal National Park are closed. Motorists are also asked to avoid the Illawarra Highway between the Hume Highway and Robertson, and the Great Western Highway between Penrith and Springwood because of reduced visibility. In north-western Sydney only local residents are allowed to use Wisemans Ferry Road and Upper Color Road under police escort. \n",
       "Work is continuing this morning to restore power supplies to tens of thousands of homes that were blacked out during wild storms that struck south-east Queensland last night. Gale force winds uprooted trees and brought down power lines, damaging homes and cars. Energex and Ergon energy have had every available person working through the night to restore power at 150 locations in and around Brisbane, west to Toowoomba and north to the Sunshine Coast. At Boonah south-west of Brisbane, protective tarpaulins were ripped from homes still undergoing repairs, following severe storms just before Christmas. At Nambour, four people were rescued after high voltage power lines fell across their car trapping them inside. And at Landsborough fierce winds sent a large tree crashing into a house, but no one was injured. \n",
       "Peru has entered two days of official mourning for the more than 220 people killed in a fire that's destroyed part of downtown Lima. Police say the fire began when a fireworks cache exploded in a shop just four blocks from Peru's Congress in a heritage-listed area famed for its Spanish colonial-era architecture. Early evening crowds buying traditional fireworks for New Year's Eve celebrations were trapped by the flames as they raced through surrounding markets and four-storey apartment buildings. Local residents blame vendors of illegal fireworks and say the death toll was exacerbated by poor traffic control in the adjoining, narrow street where cars - themselves engulfed by fire -  trapped fleeing victims. Hospitals have urged the public to donate medicine for the hundreds of burns victims. Peru's President Alejandro Toledo has cut short his beach holiday to oversee an inquiry. \n",
       "President General Pervez Musharraf says Pakistan wants to defuse the brewing crisis with India, but was prepared to respond vigorously to any attack. \"Pakistan stands for peace, Pakistan wants peace, Pakistan wants to reduce tension,\" he said. \"Let the two countries move towards peace and harmony. \"However, Pakistan has taken all counter measures, if any war is thrust on Pakistan, the Pakistan armed forces and the 140 million people of Pakistan are fully prepared to face all consequences with all their might.\" The President said he had received the \"support of all political parties\". President Musharraf also said he welcomed the intervention of the international community in trying to defuse the potentially explosive crisis. \"We would like anybody to play a useful and positive role in defusing the tension.\" The United States, the European Union and the Group of eight industrialised nations among others, have all called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and resolve the stand-off through dialogue. President Musharraf repeated his offer of holding talks with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. \"I am for dialogue and I keep on saying this and India keeps on rejecting which gives me a feeling that I am begging to India. If they accept it we do not reject it at all,\" he said. On Friday he said he was willing to meet Prime Minister Vajpayee on the sidelines of the January 4-6 South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in Nepal. India ruled out any face-to-face talks. Military tensions erupted between India and Pakistan after the bloody December 13 raid on the Indian parliament. India accuses Pakistan's military intelligence of masterminding the assault, but Pakistan denies the allegation. With both countries massing troops along the border, Pakistan Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar warned Saturday that the dispute was growing \"dangerously  tense\" and any small act of provocation could snowball into conflict. President Musharraf said one of the goals of Sunday's meeting was \"to take stock of the internal situation, the domestic environment\". \"I want to eradicate militancy, extremism, intolerance from Pakistani society and I also said I would like to eradicate any form of terrorism from the soil of Pakistan.\" However he warned the \"tension that has mounted on our eastern border in fact is creating obstacles and hurdles\". \n",
       "Talks between Afghan and British officials in Kabul have ended without final agreement on the deployment of a international security force. The lack of a suitable translation of the document meant a further delay. Authorities in Kabul have been giving conflicting signals for weeks now over the number of peacekeepers they would allow and the role the international force would play. The Foreign Minister, Dr Abdullah, appeared to be ending the confusion, saying an agreement was about to be signed. \"There is already the agreement, so it was finalised,\" he said. But a spokesman for the Interior Minister, Yunis Kanooni, emerged soon after to say there was no agreement and nothing to sign. Scores of British peacekeepers are already patrolling the streets of Kabul in tandem with Afghan police. But proposals to enlarge the force to as many as 5,000 international peacekeepers have been criticised by some commanders as tantamount to foreign occupation. \n",
       "The Israeli army has killed three Palestinian militants who attacked one of its armoured vehicles in the northern Gaza Strip. The three Palestinians opened fire with rifles at the vehicle between the Jewish settlements of Alei Sinai and Nitzanit, on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip. They were killed by shell fire from a tank, the sources said. During the fire fight an Israeli army observation post called in tank fire which killed the three gunmen. The killing brings the death toll of 15 months of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation to 1,121 people, including 865 Palestinians and 234 Israelis. Alei Sinai was attacked on October 2 when two gunmen from the radical Islamic group Hamas infiltrated the settlement and opened fire on the residents, killing two teenage Israelis. Two Palestinian gunmen also killed an Israeli settler in Alei Sinai on December 2 before being killed by the army. \n",
       "Only a protest will can now stop Bumblebee 5 from wining the overall handicap honours in the 57th Sydney to Hobart yacht race. The Ian Murray-skippered boat appears to have clinched the coveted title after its nearest rival, Zeus Two failed to finish in the early hours of this morning. Zeus Two is still eight hours away from the finish line. The nine metre yacht is among 16 boats still to finish. All four Tasmanian boats have finished. Meanwhile, a South Australian yacht in the Sydney to Hobart has been towed to St Helens on Tasmania's east coast after losing its rudder. Liberator, skippered by Geoff Catt, got into trouble yesterday 46 miles from Eddystone Point when it apparently struck an object. The were no reported injuries onboard. \n",
       "South Africa is considering playing left arm spinner Nicky Boje in this week's third Test against Australia in Sydney. Boje was forced to withdraw from the South African squad before the start of the tour due to injury. South African captain Shaun Pollock says he hopes Boje arrives in time to prepare for the Test. \"Nicky Boje might be out in time,\" he said. \"As soon as he was fit and ready he was going to come over but we'll be picking the best possible eleven for the Sydney Test.\" \n",
       "Spain has begun its Hopman Cup campaign in Perth with a 3-0 victory over Argentina. Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Tommy Robredoboth won their singles matches, and then teamed to win the mixed doubles. Sanchez-Vicario says she is hoping to win her second Hopman Cup title after winning the tournament with her brother Emilio in 1990. \"It would be very nice to start the year off and as I say it's always tough but it's a very good start for me and I'm looking forward with Tommy to see if we can be the champions again,\" she said. Today, the United States will play France. Meanwhile, world number one Lleyton Hewitt says he will not be putting pressure on himself to win next month's Australian Tennis Open in Melbourne. Hewitt yesterday teamed with fellow Australian Alicia Molik to beat Switzerland 3-0 in their opening tie at the Hopman Cup in Perth. Hewitt says his first objective will be to reach the second week of the grand slam event. \"I think if I play my best tennis and give a 100 per cent no matter who I play I think I'm in with a good chance of getting through to the second week and if that happens then most times in a grand slam it's sort of anyone's tournament from there,\" he said. \n",
       "New Zealand has rewarded Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson in its New Years Honours list. Jackson, who has spent seven years on filming the Tolkien classic in his home country has been made a companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. The first of three films employed a cast of over 2,000 and had a budget of $534 million - far and away New Zealand's biggest production ever. There is no chance Jackson himself will become a Lord though - New Zealand's Labour Government last year dropped knighthoods in favour of local honours. \n",
       "The next few hours are crucial for firefighters on alert in the Blue Mountains. Firefighters are working on a 25 kilometre fire front in the area, which it is feared will devour homes if the wind picks up this afternoon. The weather bureau had initially predicted 80 kilometre an hour southerly wind gusts, but has revised its forecast to 30 kilometres an hour. The wind change is expected to reach the Blue Mountains in the next hour. Mark Williams, the incident controller for the Blue Mountains region, says fire crews will stop back-burning as soon as the wind change nears the area. \"Soon as we get word the southerly change for instance, is getting close to the Blue Mountains area, we initially stop our back-burning,\" Mr Williams said. \"Tie it into a local creek or something as close as possible so that it's contained within that area, so we don't have further outbreaks.\" \n",

He says he issued the appeal at a meeting with leaders of the banking community. \"I'm very concerned about what has happened in Argentina,\" Mr Rodriguez Saa said. He says he has asked banks to remain open from 8:00am to 8:00pm Monday, to be able to cash checks of up to 1,000 pesos or $US1,000 per person. \n",

A 16-year-old boy, who was a passenger in the car when it hit a telephone pole, remains in critical condition. New South Wales has recorded 18 holiday deaths. Seven people have died on Queensland roads, five in Victoria, three in the Northern Territory, two each in Western Australia and South Australia. The ACT and Tasmania remain fatality free. \n",
       "The Federal Government says new national fuel quality standards for petrol and diesel will greatly reduce toxic emissions from cars and trucks. The Federal Minister for the Environment, David Kemp, says state and territory inspectors will conduct random fuel sampling at refineries, distributor terminals, and petrol stations across the country. He says the new laws, introduced today, will cut the pollution from vehicles and it is hoped this will lead to a reduction in respiratory illness in the community. Lead in petrol will be prohibited under the new laws. The 2.5 million cars built prior to 1986, which use leaded petrol, will be required to use lead replacement petrol. Mr Kemp says it is expected emissions of major pollutants such as benzene and carbon monoxide will be reduced by at least 40 per cent by 2010. By 2020, emissions of those pollutants will be reduced by 70 per cent. \n",
       "Americans' fears about airplane security continue to increase, after a man made it through two separate flights with a loaded gun in his carry-on luggage. The man was finally stopped before boarding a third plane in Memphis. The man had travelled from Florida to Atlanta, and then Atlanta to Memphis. He was attempting to board his return flight last night when he was stopped by security personnel for a random check. They discovered a loaded 9mm Beretta semi-automatic pistol in his hand luggage. The man acknowledged the gun was his, and was released on $5,000 bail. There is no suggestion he was planning any sort of terrorist attack, but his ability to complete two flights while carrying the weapon has again highlighted airline security problems. The incident follows last week's drama when a man was able to board a plane from Paris to Miami with explosives in his shoes. \n",
       "A team of police is currently escorting two Swiss tourists back to the safety of a central Australian community after their vehicle sank in sand in the Finke River overnight. A police spokesman says police were called to the area 100 kilometres west of Alice Springs, after an emergency beacon was activated and received by Australian Search and Rescue. The tourists had tried to cross the river when their vehicle became submerged in soft sand. The spokesman says a ground unit also attended, but police officers had to walk the final 12 kilometres to reach the stranded Swiss nationals who were stuck in the vehicle. The tourists and the rescue team are expected to walk for about four hours this morning before driving to the Hermansburg community. \n",

Almost half the fleet has crossed the finish line. After leading since the race began three days ago Kontrol crossed the line at 2:15am. Another Victorian boat, Tevake, claimed second place just one minute clear of Wild Card, the only Tasmanian entry in the fleet. The fast-finishing Tevake crossed the line at 6:15am to be runner-up for the second year in a row. Kontrol skipper Peter Blake says modifications to his boat have been more than successful. Firefighters in New South Wales have spent another night back-burning in preparation for the weekend's heatwave conditions. No more homes were lost overnight, despite more than 50 fires still raging around the state. Firefighters are fearing the worst with hot and windy conditions forecast over the next two days. Spencer north of Sydney, and the lower Blue Mountains continue to be of the greatest concern. Homes between Bulabarra and Lapstone are set to be in the line of fire if the forecast wind changes materialise in those areas. Extensive back-burning was conducted overnight, with firefighters concentrating on areas south of Sydney at Sutherland, Illawarra and Shoalhaven. At Spencer, firefighters are desperately trying to stop the flames from spreading across the Hawkesbury River. However, there is some relief in sight for exhausted firefighters, with the arrival this morning of 130 officers from Queensland. Those firefighters are heading to the Hunter region to help battle a blaze at Cessnock. \n",

The crew of the Assa Abloy will not be able to spend too much time celebrating - the Round the World yachts have only a few hours rest before racing on to Auckland. \n",
       "A United States federal magistrate has refused to free on bail a British man accused of trying to detonate his explosives-laden shoes on a transatlantic flight. At a hearing in United States Federal Court, Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Margaret Cronin said Richard Reid was in possession of a \"functioning, improvised device,\" which \"if placed beside an outer wall could have or would have created a large hole in the fuselage of the plane\". The device contained an explosive called TATP. US Magistrate Judith Dein refused to grant bail for Reid, 28, but left open the possibility of his release later. Reid is charged with intimidation and interfering with a flight crew - offenses that carry 20-year jail terms. No additional charges were filed. He allegedly tried to set fire to his sneakers Saturday on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami that was diverted to Boston. Investigators say the explosives in his shoes were powerful enough to have created a major disaster. \n",
       "The Palestinian leadership is calling for US peace envoy Anthony Zinni to return to the region to work for a cease-fire and a return to peace talks. Mr Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general, was sent to the region in late November by US Secretary of State Colin Powell. However, he was recalled earlier this month after failing to bring a halt to the bloodshed. A statement issued after a meeting chaired by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called for a \"quick return of Zinni and his team to proceed to the application of the Mitchell Plan and the Tenet Memorandum.\" The internationally-backed Mitchell Plan calls for an end to Israeli-Palestinian violence and the implementation of confidence-building measures, before a return to peace talks. The Tenet Memorandum, a blueprint for implementing a cease-fire, was agreed several months ago but failed to take hold on the ground. The Palestinian leadership underscored the \"importance of the role played by the American administration in the peace process, with the support of Russia and the European Union.\" The US State Department has said Mr Zinni will only return when he and Mr Powell believe his presence could be effective in bringing about a cease-fire. \n",
       "The Northern Territory Aids Council says it is not surprised the Territory's rate of HIV infection through male to female sex is twice the national rate. A report in the Centre for Disease Control Bulletin says 21 percent of HIV infections in the Territory were from male to female sex, compared to 10 per cent nationally. The council's Frank Farmer says it is another reason for people to practice safe sex. \"We do need to be reminded, I think people become a bit complacent and they feel that it can't happen to them,\" Mr Farmer said. \"What these statistics show is that there is a shift in the means of transmission... previous figures were about 80 per cent, but male to male contact has turned around here so that it is a bit of a wake up call for people.\" \n",
       "There is a one in 20 chance of a dramatic rise in world sea levels over the next century due to global warming, according to a new risk assessment. The survey by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and Norwegian environmental safety organisation Det Norske Veritas, says there is a 5 per cent chance of the giant West Antarctic Ice Sheet disintegrating due to climate change. Scientist David Vaughan says if that happens, sea levels would rise by one metre in the next 100 years. \"You have to balance the likelihood against the severity of the impacts, and in this case even a 5 per cent chance of this happening is really damn serious,\" he said. Scientists have already predicted a rise in sea levels of 50 centimetres over the next century, due to a combination of climate change and increased extraction of ground water. Mr Vaughan says that estimate did not factor in melting Antarctic ice. \"So we might be looking at something like 1.5 metres in the next century,\" Mr Vaughan said. Mr Vaughan says the possible break-up of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which accounts for 13 per cent of ice on the frozen continent, is not related to the impact of human industrial activity on the climate. He says it is part of a far older process. However, he says major world polluters cannot walk away from the problem. \"The potential impacts of a major change in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are severe - sea level rise will be fantastically expensive for developed nations with coastal cities and dire for poor populations in low-lying coastal areas,\" Mr Vaughan said. \n",

       "New South Wales firefighters are hoping lighter winds will help ease their workload today but are predicting \"nasty\" conditions over the weekend. While the winds are expected to ease somewhat today, the weather bureau says temperatures will be higher. More than 100 fires are still burning across New South Wales. The Rural Fire Service says the change may allow it to concentrate more on preventative action, but there is no room for complacency. Mark Sullivan, from the Rural Fire Service, says while conditions may be a little kinder to them today, the outlook for the weekend has them worried. \"It certainly appears from the weather forecast, with very high temperatures and high winds that it certainly could be a nasty couple of days ahead,\" Mr Sullivan said. One of the areas causing greatest concern today is the 30-kilometre long blaze in the lower Blue Mountains. Firefighters are also keeping a close eye on a blaze at Spencer north of Sydney, which yesterday broke through containment lines. There are concerns that fire may jump the Hawkesbury River. Backburning continues in the state's central west and south of Sydney in the Shoalhaven. In the Illawarra, firefighters have been able to carry out back-burning operations in three areas. Operations were carried out in parts of Mt Kembla, as well as an area bounded by Appin Road and the Old Princes Highway at Helensburgh. An area west of Windy Gully near Cataract Dam was also targeted. Meanwhile, Illawarra police have arrested three teenagers in relation to bushfires at Shellharbour, on the south coast of New South Wales. A spokesman says three small fires were extinguished around 7:30pm AEDT yesterday. A short time later police arrested three 15-year-old boys from Shellharbour, Barrack Heights and Shell Cove. All three have been interviewed but no charges have been laid. \n",
       "Pakistan's Foreign Ministry has announced retaliatory sanctions against India, saying it would also downgrade embassy representation and ban Indian planes from its airspace. \"Pakistan regrets the Indian decision to downgrade embassy representation by 50 per cent and confine staff to the municipal limits of New Delhi and ban access to airspace,\" ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said. \"Such efforts will only increase tension and we are forced to take retaliatory actions. \"We will downgrade their embassy staff here, confine them to Islamabad limits, and will also ban their access to Pakistan's airspace.\" As tension mounted between the two rivals after the December 13 attack on the Parliament complex in new Delhi, Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh earlier announced a set of new sanctions. Pakistani aircraft would not be allowed to fly over Indian airspace from January 1, and the Indian embassy in Islamabad and the Pakistan mission in New Delhi will have to reduce their staff by 50 per cent, he said. Pakistani embassy staff would be confined to movement within New Delhi, he added. Mr Singh said the measures were being taken as a result of Pakistan's attempts to \"dupe\" the international community with \"cosmetic measures and non measures\" against militant groups operating in its territory. India has accused Pakistani military intelligence of sponsoring the Parliament attack and has threatened retaliation, including possible military action. \n",
       "A spokesman for Afghanistan's Defence Ministry claims Osama bin Laden has fled to Pakistan. Defence Ministry spokesman Mohamad Habeel says the Saudi-born dissident is in hiding under the protection of supporters of a radical Islamic leader who helped to create the fundamentalist Taliban. \"Osama himself is under the protection of Maulana Fazalur Rehman in Pakistan, but we don't know for sure in which part of it,\" Mohamad Habeel said. \"He lives in areas which are under the influence and control of Fazalur Rehman supporters, I cannot say from which sources we have received this information. \"Bin Laden and his men are no longer here [in Afghanistan].\" Mr Rehman, who is under house arrest, is head of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Party, a long time supporter of bin Laden, the leader of the Al Qaeda network which is blamed for the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Mohamad Habeel said bin Laden's support in Afghanistan had collapsed completely. \"His supporters have no presence any more,\" he said. \"There may be individuals here who have hidden, but altogether we can say that his resistance is over. \"His last remaining forces have fled to areas along the border with Afghanistan and Pakistan.\" \n",

Mr Giuliani, speaking just four days ahead of his final day in office, further defended his tough stance on crime and homelessness. Time magazine's 2001 Person of the Year also praised New York's diversity as the source of strength pulling the city through the difficult aftermath of September 11's deadly attacks. \"This place has to be sanctified,\" Mr Giuliani said. \"This place has to become a place which, when anybody comes here, they are going to feel the great power and emotion of what it means to be an American.\" During his reign, many in the city's black and Hispanic communities decried Mr Giuliani's 'knee-jerk' support for New York's Police Department during police brutality scandals. However, the Mayor insists his policing strategy has been highly effective. \"The reality is that the model that was adopted for dealing with crime in New York City is the very, very best way to ensure you can make your city safe,\" Mr Giuliani said. \"I felt that my job as the mayor was to turn around the city, because I believed - rightly or wrongly - that we had one last chance to do that.\" Mr Giuliani, a Republican, has served two terms as New York City's Mayor since 1993. Term limits prevent him from seeking a third term in office, and he will be succeeded by billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg. \n",
       "Australia's quicks and opening batsmen have put the side in a dominant position going into day three of the Boxing Day Test match against South Africa at the MCG. Australia is no wicket for 126, only 151 runs shy of South Africa after Andy Bichel earlier starred as the tourists fell for 277. When play was abandoned due to rain a few overs short of scheduled stumps yesterday, Justin Langer was not out 67 and Matthew Hayden 55. The openers went on the attack from the start, with Langer's innings including six fours and Hayden's eight. Earlier, Shaun Pollock and Nantie Haywood launched a vital rearguard action to help South Africa to a respectable first innings total. The pair put on 44 runs for the final wicket to help the tourists to 277. The South Africans had slumped to 9 for 233 through a combination of Australia's good bowling, good fielding and good luck. After resuming at 3 for 89 yesterday morning, the tourists looked to be cruising as Jacques Kallis and Neil McKenzie added 72 without loss. But then Bichel suddenly had them reeling after snatching two wickets in two balls. First he had Jacques Kallis caught behind for 38, although Kallis could consider himself very unlucky as replays showed his bat was a long way from the ball. On the next ball, Bichel snatched a sharp return catch to dismiss Lance Klusener first ball and have a shot at a hat-trick. Bichel missed out on the hat-trick and Mark Boucher and Neil McKenzie again steadied the South African innings, adding 67 before the introduction of part-timer Mark Waugh to the attack paid off for Australia. Waugh removed Boucher for 43, caught by Bichel. Brett Lee then chipped in, trapping McKenzie leg before for 67 with a perfect inswinger. Bichel continued his good day in the field, running out Claude Henderson for 5 with a direct-hit from the in-field. Lee roared in to Allan Donald, bouncing him and then catching the edge with a rising delivery, which Ricky Ponting happily swallowed at third slip to remove the returning paceman for a duck. Bichel did not get his hat-trick but ended with the best figures of the Australian bowlers, after also picking up the final wicket of Nantie Haywood for 14. Lee took 3 for 77 and Glenn McGrath 2 for 66. \n",
       "A rafter who raised the alarm after most of his party was swept into the Franklin River, in Tasmania's south-west, says for nearly 24 hours he did not know whether his four friends had survived. Richard Romaszko was rafting down the Collingwood River when the party was hit by a huge water swell just before the junction with the Franklin. Mr Romaszko pulled himself to safety and, after camping overnight, he alerted a tour group. He was able to use the group's satellite phone to raise the alarm. A second member of the party was found nearby yesterday afternoon, while the other three were winched out by helicopter about 8:00pm AEDT. Mr Romanszko says he went into survival mode. \"When we hit the bottom of the rapid there was a big wave that overturned the rafts,\" he said. \"Before we knew it, we were in the Franklin River. \"At least my raft was upside down and the guy who was with me, his raft was upside down.\" \n",

       "Firefighters across New South Wales are gearing up for a wind change that may bring further property losses today. More than 100 fires now ring two-thirds of the greater Sydney area. The blazes stretch south of the Royal National Park and north of Wollongong all the way to the Blue Mountains and up towards the edge of the Baulkham Hills shire. Fires are also burning around Huskisson on the far south coast, and as far inland as Mudgee, Narromine and Kempsey, and the Richmond Valley in the north. However, the major areas of concern today are the southern Sydney suburbs of Heathcote and Engadine. Thousands of residents in those suburbs were evacuated overnight. Senior forecaster with the Sydney Weather Bureau Ian Robertson, says the greatest risk will come when winds change direction this afternoon. \"We're looking at another dry day ahead throughout the state, particularly along the coast... more average sort of temperatures but the trick will be the winds,\" Mr Robertson said. \"We're looking at south-west winds this morning, an east to south-east sea breeze along the coast, which is going to make things quite challenging for firefighting.\" Between 4,000 and 5,000 firefighters are currently battling the blazes. Crews have already been brought in from Victoria, but the Rural Fire Service says it expects to call on other states for help. Service spokesman John Winter says property losses have been high. \"We are estimating that around 150 homes have been lost, obviously there are areas we're yet to confirm property losses,\" Mr Winter said. \n",

He says Mr Reid had become more and more militant in his outlook, after becoming involved with a group of Muslim extremists. The mosque leader says Mr Reid was easily led and he is not surprised at what happened. \"I wouldn't say we were totally surprised, because we said if we remember how he left us this is what he was believing in,\" Mr Baker said. \"This was the type of jihad that he was beginning to believe in. \"September the eleventh would have had a profound effect on him.\" Meanwhile, US television is reporting Osama bin Laden loyalists held prisoner in Afghanistan have told US troops Mr Reid trained in their camps. \n",

The one-way fares are for flights to Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Launceston and Canberra. Vigin Blue spokesman David Huttner says the fares are to thank customers for their support, particularly in Victoria, which has become Virgin's second largest operational base. However, he says it is also very much about ensuring the airline's position in the market. \"Suggestions recently in the press by Mr Fox that Ansett's main goal is simply to put Virgin Blue out of business, well, you know, we wish them the best of luck in that endeavour,\" he said. \"Everybody else has failed so far but if that's the only goal in business, they claim to be in the spirit of competition then well, good on them.\" \n",

       "A Palestinian man has been shot dead as Israeli forces charged into Palestinian-controlled land in the northern West  Bank in hot pursuit of gunmen who opened fire on them earlier, Palestinian officials said. Walid Saadi, 53, was killed by heavy machine-gun fire as tanks and helicopters fought a pitched battle with the Palestinian gunmen, holed up in a house on the edge of the town of Jenin after attacking an Israeli Army post, Palestinian medics said. Israeli military sources said two armed men had been shot, although it was not immediately clear if Saadi was one of them or a civilian caught in the intense fire. Israeli forces did not say how many gunmen they were facing down, although officials had earlier said it was two. An army spokesman said the gunmen had been heading through Israel-controlled territory east of the town when they ran into an army post and opened fire. It claimed they had been planning to attack the nearby Jewish settlement of Qadim. The Israeli soldiers returned fire, but the men escaped into Palestinian self-rule land next to the northern town of Jenin. The army chased them into land under the control of the Palestinian Authority and tracked them down to a house where the men took cover. The Palestinians then threw two grenades at soldiers and border police, injuring one policeman slightly. A firefight erupted around the house, Palestinian and Israeli security officials said, during which the tanks fired two shells into the building. Helicopters also opened fire, killing Saadi, Palestinian officials said. According to Jenin hospital officials, two Palestinians were injured in the exchange, as the tanks and two jeeps entered 400 metres into Palestinian territory to besiege the house. \n",

The Proteas will resume at three for 89 after day one was badly affected by rain with only 40 overs possible. Australian paceman Glenn McGrath, who has two wickets, says the catch taken by Matthew Hayden yesterday is typical of Australia's outstanding slips fielding this summer. \"In the series so far there's been some great catches - Ricky Ponting in the last Test, occasionally I get one myself,\" he said. \"It gives you so much more confidence when you know 99 per cent of the catches that go flying to the slips or through the slips are going to be taken.\" \n",
       "Thousands of firefighters remain on the ground across New South Wales this morning, as they assess the extent of fires burning around Sydney and on the state's south coast. Firefighters are battling a fire band stretching from around Campbelltown, south-west of Sydney, to the Royal National Park. Hundreds of people have been evacuated from small villages to the south and south-west of Sydney. Authorities estimate more than 60 properties have been destroyed in the greater Sydney area. Fourteen homes have been destroyed in the Hawkesbury area north of Sydney, and 20 properties have been ruined at Jervis Bay. John Winter, from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, says firefighters' main concern is the fire band from Campbelltown through to the coast. \"That is going to be a very difficult area today, we do expect that the Royal National Park is likely to be impacted by fire later in the morning,\" he said. \"Certainly in terms of population risk and threat to property that band is going to be our area of greatest concern.\" In the ACT, it appears the worst of the fire danger may have passed though strong winds are expected to keep firefighters busy today. The fires have burned more than 800 hectares over the past two days. Yesterday, winds of up to 80 kilometres an hour fanned blazes in a dozen areas, including Queanbeyan, O'Connor, Mount Wanniassa, Red Hill and Black Mountain. Strong winds are again predicted for today but fire authorities are confident they have the resources to contain any further blazes. A total fire ban is in force in the ACT today and tomorrow.

The Queen also expressed her belief in the importance of faith at such times. \"In these circumstances so many of us, whatever our religion, need our faith more than ever to sustain and guide us. \"Every one of us needs to believe in the value of all that is good and honest.\" Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf also referred to September 11 in his annual Christmas speech to the nation, describing how the attacks concerned everyone and had changed life itself. \"The need for community and friendship beyond borders is even greater following these tragedies,\" he said. Spain's King Juan Carlos said the outrages in America opened a new stage in world history. \"The terrible attacks of September 11 on the US, of a previously unknown magnitude, have shaken the conscience of humanity and shattered many of the ideas on which we base the way we live,\" he said. However, King Juan said the international community's reaction showed no tolerance for that kind of attack. \"The reaction of the international community has show in a clear way its willingness in the future to prevent those who think that violence and terror are valuable instruments for imposing their ideas and exercising their tyranny,\" he said. \n",

A total of 76 entrants are in this year's race, including eight round-the-world yachts, which are expected to give last year's line honours winner, Swedish maxi Nicorette, a run for its money. The round the world yachts are set for a flying beginning, with a 200-metre headstart designed to get them out of harm's way. The boats will have to round a buoy further north near Sydney heads, to equalise the distance. Ludde Ingvall, the skipper of Nicorette, says the split start could help the maxis next year. \"Split starts are good and maybe next year they will move all the big boats into the front line so that we can get away without hitting somebody,\" he said. Skipper Ingvall says his start tactics are easy. \"At the start it's easy - don't break and don't collide and don't go around and don't make yourself look silly,\" he said. The New South Wales Weather Bureau says there is a possibility of waves of up to five metres in Bass Strait for this year's Sydney to Hobart yacht race. Severe weather forecaster Ken Batt says if a low pressure system develops more off Tasmania, the worst case scenario could be strong winds and large seas. \"As the yachts hit the stronger winds in Bass Strait you'd be looking at say four to five metre significant wave heights,\" Mr Batt said. \n",

Melbourne's shaky early summer weather is not yet on the improve. This is Test cricket's traditional day of days and it is receiving Melbourne's traditional greeting - cool and cloudy with possible showers. The other questions are over each team's pace attack. South Africa will probably be forced to take a huge punt on veteran Alan Donald, while Australia is unlikely to punt on Brad Williams, returning Andy Bichel to Test cricket. Williams was called up to the 12 after Jason Gillespie was ruled out of the Test due to a right shoulder injury. Bichel says he is looking forward to the challenge of a call-up to the starting side. \"I feel that I'm ready to go for this game and I'm looking forward to it,\" Bichel said. \"The Boxing Day Test has been a good one for me.

US and Afghan forces have been searching for signs of bin Laden, the number one suspect in the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, around Tora  Bora since forces from his Al Qaeda network fled last weekend. US warplanes and Afghan forces had launched extensive attacks on the network of caves where Al Qaeda members had been hiding out. An Afghan commander in charge in the Tora Bora caves region said Saturday that bin Laden had probably gone to Pakistan. The Pentagon said on Monday that it had no idea where bin Laden was now although it believed he had been in the Tora Bora region until a few days before. \n",

       "Israel has rejected Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's bid to make his annual visit to Bethlehem for Christmas Eve during an security cabinet meeting early today. \"The security cabinet made its decision based on the fact that Arafat is not working to dismantle terror organizations and to foil terror attacks against Israel and to arrest and punish terrorists, including the murderers of tourism minister Rhavam Zeevi,\" a statement from Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office said. Earlier, Mr Arafat declared he would walk to Bethlehem for Christmas Eve Mass if he has to if Israeli authorities refused him access to the biblical town. Mr Arafat's statement comes as Palestinians in Gaza buried six teenagers killed in the worst internal Palestinian violence in seven years. The funerals in Gaza were peaceful, with Palestinian police staying away and mourners agreeing no weapons were to be carried. This has been a difficult week for Yasser Arafat: he put his reputation on the line by ordering the arrest of some key Palestinian militants in the most important radical group Hamas, then declared an end to its campaign of suicide bombings and other attacks against Israel. Another smaller, but important radical group, Islamic Jihad, might follow Hamas's lead. But the key to all this is Israel's reaction. If it eases its blockade of towns in the West Bank, then Yasser Arafat will have something to show for his efforts. \n",
       "A Victorian couple is seeking approval to have a baby that has been genetically matched to their first child in a bid to save the toddler from a rare blood disease. The in-vitro fertalisation (IVF) technique involves testing a three day old embryo for inherited genetic disease and ensuring it is a perfect match. The young child has a disease called franconi-anaemia and without a bone marrow donation from a sibling is likely to die before the age of 15. The toddler's parents have requested permission to create another child, but the procedure extends beyond the boundaries of normal IVF technology where embryos are screened for inherited genetic diseases. Approval must be given for blood stem cells from the placenta to be transplanted to the critically ill child. Professor Alan Trounson deputy director of the Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development says the institute is ready to carry out the procedure. \"There is nothing in the law that would prevent that decision being made by the infertility treatment authority,\" Professor Trounson said.Professor Trounson does not expect any opposition to the technology. \"Who wouldn't think about how you could save a sick child's life. \"I would have thought at Christmas time that's exactly what you would want to do, and that's exactly how you would be supportive of a family making that kind of decision.\" The technology has already been used to save a child in the United States. \n",
       "Japanese officials say their Coast Guard has sunk an unidentified boat after an exchange of fire in the East China Sea. The BBC reports the unidentified boat, which resembled a fishing trawler, was spotted cruising off south-western Japan by a naval reconnaissance plane. More than 20 Japanese coastguard vessels were mobilised to give chase. Japanese officials said warning shots were fired on several occasions, but the boat ignored orders to stop and continued heading west towards China. The officials said crew members appeared on deck brandishing metal pipes and several hours after the chase began there was an exchange of gunfire in which two Japanese sailors were injured. The patrol boats then sank the vessel and its 15 man crew was thrown into the sea. Some reports said it resembled a North Korean spy boat, but there was also speculation it could have held Chinese smugglers. Meanwhile, the Coast Guard is continuing efforts to recover crew members. Six of the 15 on board have so far been recovered from the ocean, although rough weather is said to be hampering rescue efforts. \n",

But at the start of the holiday season many are venturing back into the skies for the first time and have not been prepared for the increased security. Queues have stretched for up to half a kilometre as suitcases have been opened and Christmas presents unwrapped.

Prime Minister John Howard is defending Dr Peter Hollingworth against criticism about the way he dealt with the claims of abuse at a Toowoomba Anglican school when he was the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane. Child protection groups still want the Governor-General to resign. The Reverend Tim Costello, who is the president of the Baptist Union of Australia, says further explanation is needed. \"I don't think he should step down at this point but I do think that having begun the process with an explanation and a clarification which still leaves some things unclear, there is probably further work on just clarifying and understanding the import of what happened,\" he said. Meanwhile, Federal Opposition leader Simon Crean has described Dr Hollingworth's explanation as insufficient. Mr Crean says there are inconsistancies regarding where Dr Hollingworth received legal advice and this must be cleared up. \"We heard the Prime Minister today saying that the Governor-General never said he got the legal advice from the Chief Justice, but that begs the question as to who he got the legal advice from,\" he said. \"I think it's terribly important that we understand where the legal advice came from and who gave it.\" \n",

Lieutenant-General Cosgrove says the man was discharged from the Army, but he says he will not comment on the circumstances of the discharge out of respect for the man's family. He says the Australian Defence Force can take take no responsibility for its soldiers once they have left the service. \"When you leave your job now will your previous company make any assessment about your skills and what you might carry to another area?\" he said. \"It's unreasonable beyond saying that they are the laws of the land and I guess people will assess more when any laws of this land have been breached by any individuals' actions.\" \n",
       "Argentina's Government has crumbled after at least 20 people were killed and hundreds injured in nationwide riots. Argentina's President Fernando de la Rua has resigned and called for a national unity government with the opposition Peronists. The President's resignation followed 48 hours of rioting across the country. People took to the streets protesting against the Government's economic austerity program. Argentina is now on the brink of defaulting on its next debt repayment, which could be the largest default ever. The opposition parties are reported to have rejected the call for a national unity government. In Washington, the International Monetary Fund said it would work with the new cabinet. Government policy has previously ruled out any devaluation of the peso, fearing a run on the currency and an even greater debt crisis. The Government has also declared a 30-day state of siege in an effort to restore order. \n",

Six months ago, Phillips Petroleum indefinitely delayed its plan to build a $1.5  billion pipeline to bring gas from the Bayu-Undan gasfield to Darwin. The company blamed the delay on its concerns with East Timor's tax regime. But today Phillips has announced it has reached a deal with East Timor's new Government which will allow the gas project to go ahead. In a statement the company says it welcomes the tax  and fiscal package offered by East Timor's Council of Ministers, and says it is an historic day.

He says he can provide documents on the manufacture of weapons and pinpoint the exact locations of secret sites. \"New factories are built in place of old factories that [were] bombed and in another place and there's substituted places to any factory,\" he said. The former chief weapons inspector for the United Nations in Iraq, Richard Butler, told ABC Radio he believes the claims could be true. \"I've read a lot of such reports from defectors, from people who've left Iraq, I can't tell you how many,\" he said. \"You get a feel about them and as I read what he said, I thought my goodness this has a real ring of authenticity about it. \"Just the detail, the names of places, the sorts of stuff he was discussing, I thought this is true,\" Mr Butler said. \n",

       "The United Nations Security Council has authorised a multinational force to help keep the peace in the Afghan capital of Kabul, with Britain leading the troops and the United States prepared to rescue them in an emergency. The 15-member council voted unanimously just two days before a vanguard of some 250 British soldiers who will be deployed tomorrow. Afghanistan's new interim government, with Hamid Karzai as Prime Minister, is to be sworn in on the same day. The initial mandate for the new force, called the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), is for six months, subject to renewal and is under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which allows the use of force. The contingents are to help guard government buildings to ensure the new Afghan interim government has a chance to end 22 years of warfare. But the resolution does not give any troop numbers, which Britain estimates could eventually reach 5,000 with NATO members France, Turkey, Italy, Canada, Spain and possibly Germany among the early arrivals. The US military will be in overall charge in case of a conflict and would help rescue the new troops in an emergency. The new force was established in principle for Kabul and its environs as part of a UN-brokered landmark accord, signed on December 5 in Bonn, Germany, among anti-Taliban Afghan groups. The agreement set up an interim government, to be followed by a transitional government and elections called for in two years. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer says despite an offer of troops, it seems likely Australian forces will not be needed for peacekeeping duties in Afghanistan. \n",

The Government and the credit sectors are already obliged to protect private data, but this is the first time the same rules have been applied to the private sector. The new laws are about consent, knowledge about data use, accuracy and security. In health, data must only be used for the purpose it is taken, for example treatment. The Federal Privacy Commissioner, Malcolm Crompton, says hospitals and doctors collecting health information now have to ask for consent. \"They're not in a position any more of being able to give that information out in an identifiable form to research organisations or to pharmaceutical companies and probably most important of all, we now have a right of access to that information, we can now go in and ask for our medical record and we have the right to see it,\" he said. The laws also apply to companies running competitions who collect names and details, as they will have to state whether the data is intended for marketing. Mr Crompton says a large culture change is happening, but it is backed by his enforcement powers. \"Often we're able to broker a solution without having to use the powers very strongly, but I think both consumers and organisations should rest assured that we will use the powers under the act if we need to do so. \"But there's very clear evidence that in the vast majority of circumstances we wont have to,\" he said. \n",

By 6:00pm local time (3:00am AEDT), two hours after the collapse, 21 injured people, mostly adults, had been taken to hospitals around the city by ambulance or helicopter, Mr Pieterse said. \"Most of those injured were those standing at the glass wall watching people ice skate,\" he added. Some of the injured included children skating on the ice rink, who were partially buried in rubble when the roof gave way, witnesses said. Some 100 square metres of roofing were believed to have collapsed. A new floor had recently been added to the shopping mall, above the rink, and \"the roof had leaked, but according to us everything was fine,\" ice rink manager Brian Bellis told the AFP news agency. There was \"a lot of dust and smoke and then people were just running and screaming, running away from where it happened,\" the South African Broadcasting Corporation radio quoted one witness as saying. Several people, including young children, were brought out on stretchers while others were helicoptered to hospital. About 100 police and soldiers cordoned off the area. One bystander, Marius duPlessis, said he was searching for his 20-year-old son who had been working at the centre. \"His car is there, but he is nowhere to be found.

       "A rare calm in the Palestinian territories has been shattered with the death of a Palestinian, killed in a firefight with Israeli forces as they moved back into a suburb of Nablus that they had left just hours earlier. Tanks and armoured cars moved into an autonomous Palestinian area of west Nablus that they had quit in the morning, although the army said the movement had been a \"tactical change\" and not an official withdrawal. Tanks also returned to a West Bank village, evacuated hours earlier. The withdrawal had been seen as a sign that the security situation had improved slightly after a dramatic drop in violence following Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat's peace call on Sunday. But the clashes and the killing, the first since Monday, ruptured the peace. Mr Arafat, apparently getting tough on Islamic extremists defying his call for a cease-fire with Israel, sent his police in the pre-dawn hours today to arrest a senior official of the radical Islamic group, Hamas, in Gaza City. Seven people were injured when the police clashed with armed protesters as they tried to arrest Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi. Weeks of knife-edge tensions had scaled down late yesterday as Israeli and Palestinian officials held their first joint security meeting since US peace envoy Anthony Zinni was recalled to Washington. The Palestinians called the meeting a \"failure\", but Israeli officials said it had gone well. They moved their forces out of west Nablus and the West Bank village of At Tira and Beitunya, but later sent them back in. No forces returned to Beitunya, however. The areas had been stormed after Hamas suicide bombers killed 26 people in Jerusalem and Haifa at the beginning of the month. \n",

Senator Hill says the Government believes the man suffered from depression and retired from the defence force. The Government says a 28-year-old man left Australia in March, but it is not yet known when he entered Afghanistan. The man has no record of military service in Australia. Authorities are continuing investigations into the men and their whereabouts but say neither man entered Afghanistan with David Hicks, who is also accused of fighting alongside the Taliban. Afghanistan's interim government has agreed to accept a 3,000-strong multinational force for six months as the United Nations geared up for vote authorising the force today. Disagreements between US allies over defining the mandate of the force and its relationship with the US military operation in Afghanistan had held up a vote on the resolution for days. But UN diplomats said last night a resolution would be adopted by the 15-member Security Council today, or by early tomorrow at the latest. In Kabul, Mohammad Qasim Fahim, defence minister in the interim administration to be inaugurated on Saturday, announced the agreement on the security force yesterday after talks with British military representatives. He said the peacekeepers would only be allowed to stay for six months, leaving when the six-month mandate of the interim administration led by Hamid Karzai comes to an end. After six months, a \"Loya Jirga\" assembly of Afghan elders is to appoint a new transitional government that will lead Afghanistan into elections. The UN draft resolution defines the role of the peacekeeping as assisting the interim authority with \"the maintenance of security in Kabul and its surrounding areas, so that the Afghan interim Authority as well as the personnel of the United Nations can operate in a secure environment\". \n",

Mr Crean says he is not calling on Dr Hollingworth to resign but he says there are still unanswered questions. \"I think it has tarnished the Office of the Governor-General, the fact that it took so long for this statement to come out,\" he said. \"Many people have been calling for it, me included. \"I think if we are to avoid further damage to the office, we need to clear it up completely.\" Brisbane's Lord Mayor says the Governor-General's explanation of his handling of child sex abuse allegations at a Queensland school raises more questions than it answers.

Unrest continued at the facility overnight with a collective voice of detainees chanting \"visa\". The Immigration Department has confirmed at least 50 to 60 detainees breached compound fencing into a prohibited zone in the facility overnight. Twenty-two buildings have been destroyed or damaged by fire in three days. It is thought the cooler temperatures, expected in Woomera today, may lead to heightened daytime detainee activity.

       "The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has called for pilots to be better trained on the risks of air turbulence. It is a response to helicopter crash last August which claimed the life of media personality Shirley Strachan. Mr Strachan was on  a solo navigation training flight on August 29 when he crashed into Mt Archer on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. Witnesses told of seeing Mr Strachan apparently struggling to control his aircraft just prior to the crash. Safety bureau director Alan Stray says the helicopter was struck by severe air turbulence, a phenomena known as a mountain wave. It caused one of the helicopter rotors to flap and strike the tail boom. While reluctant to attribute blame, Mr Stray says mountain waves are not uncommon and Mr Strachan could have been better advised of local weather conditions prior to the flight. He says the accident is a wake up call to flight trainers to ensure students are fully educated on the dangers of weather phenomena. The helicopter training company which owned the aircraft Mr Strachan died in has declined to comment in detail on the findings. Blue Tongue Helicopters owner, Helen Gillies, says the company respects the findings of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Mrs Gillies says the investigation was a thorough one, but says that the incident is still too painful to discuss.

The matter has been brought by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions following ASIC's investigation of the company. The original Harris Scarfe business went into receivership in April with debts of about $160 million. A management buyout by executives not connected with the original company was finalised last month. The buyout saw the closure of 12 stores around Australia and the retention of 23 others in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. \n",

On the last day of hearings into the death of race marshall Graham Beveridge, the Grand Prix Corporation's legal team sought judicial assurance next year's event would be able to go ahead. Coroner Graeme Johnston said his recommendations were unlikely to alter the corporation's plans for the 2002 race and they would include nothing that could not reasonably be dealt with before the forthcoming race. Ross Ray QC, representing the Grand Prix Corporation and the Australian Confederation of Motor Sports, outlined plans to increase the height of debris fences and seek safety assessments from independent experts. Up to 5,000 soldiers will be deployed in Afghanistan later this month as an international force to provide security for the country's interim government, which is scheduled to take power this weekend. British Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon says up to 1,500 British troops will lead the force, which will begin its deployment from December 28. Named the International Security Assistance Force, it will be based in the capital, Kabul, and it is expected to be there for at least three months. Announcing the British deployment, Mr Hoon said with the current tensions in Afghanistan, it will be a difficult and sometimes dangerous mission. An advance unit of 100 British marines will be in the country by the weekend with the United Nations expected to mandate the force before then. Australian involvement in the peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan is to be determined by Britain. Australia has offered to take part in the force, but British defence sources have not revealed the nature of Canberra's offer. The sources say Britain has received too many offers for light infantry, but not enough for engineering, mine-clearing, and other logistical needs. Meanwhile,  Afghan forces have begun handing over captured Al Qaeda fighters to a new interrogation centre at the US military base of Camp Rhino in southern Afghanistan. The numbers are likely to swell as the hunt continues for Al Qaeda loyalists fleeing toward Pakistan. Fifteen foreign fighters, captured near the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, have now been transferred to the interrogation centre at the US marine base outside Kandahar. Another five prisoners, including the Australian, David Hicks, are being held offshore on a US military ship. Anti-Taliban forces are continuing search for some 500 Al Qaeda fighters, believed to be still at large in the mountains around Tora Bora near the Pakistan border. Local commanders said they had captured 40 foreign fighters over the past few days and were holding them at the nearby city of Jalalabad, pending orders from Kabul.

       "After the torching of more than 20 buildings over the past three days, the situation at the Woomera Detention Centre overnight appeared relatively calm. There was, however, tension inside the South Australian facility, with up to 50 detainees breaking into a prohibited zone. The group became a problem for staff after breaching a fence within the centre. At one point, staff considered using water cannon to control the detainees. It is not known if they actually resorted to any tough action but a group of men wearing riot gear, possibly Star Force police officers brought in on standby, could be seen in one of the compounds. Late yesterday, government authorities confirmed that two detainees had committed acts of self harm. One of them needed stitches and is believed to have been taken away in an ambulance. No other details have been released. \n",
       "Anti-child abuse groups are calling on Australia's Governor-General to resign or explain to a full Senate inquiry how he handled claims of alleged sexual abuse at a Queensland Anglican school. Dr Peter Hollingworth has released a statement responding to claims he failed to act on abuse at the Toowoomba school in 1990 when he was the Anglican Archbishop. In a three-page statement, Dr Hollingworth says he could no longer stand by and allow completely unfounded allegations to be made about him. He says at the time of the alleged abuse, legal obligations played heavily in his decision not to intervene personally. The Governor-General says he relied on advice from church officials at the time, who told him not to intervene because it would jeopardise the church's insurance policy. Hetty Johnston, from the People's Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse, says the Governor Generals version of events is hard to believe. \"If Dr Hollingworth denies these allegations and refutes them, the voracity of those people who have made these allegations against him need to be tested in a Senate inquiry because there is a lot evidence that disputes the voracity of the statements made by Dr Hollingworth,\" Ms Johnston said. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie says while the Governor-General has faced serious criticism about his sensitivity in the situation, legal and insurance considerations are a sad reality. \"The Governor-General's comment that the issue would have been approached differently and better, now might seem hollow to those involved, but he must be given credit now for having issued [a] statement. \"I am sure that armed with the wisdom of hindsight, the issue would have been better handled,\" Mr Beattie said. \n",
       "The Flanders graveyard of thousands of Australian World War I soldiers in Belgium could be overrun by a motorway. Flemish authorities are considering a new bypass through the heart of the Pilkem Ridge battlefield, the site of the opening infantry campaign of the Third Battle of Ypres from July to November 1917, in which 9,200 Australian servicemen lost their lives. Five thousand of the Australians are accounted for, but if the proposed route gets the go ahead, many of the thousands still missing will be buried under bitumen and heavy traffic. The proposed route would split the battlefield in two, and also run close to about a dozen war cemeteries in Belgium maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The route of the motorway is to be decided early next year. \n",
       "Federal Labor MP Carmen Lawrence says there is a lot of momentum within the party for the ALP to change its policy on asylum seekers. Dr Lawrence says maintaining the policy will lose the sympathy of some sections of the community who have thought very carefully about the issues. She says it will also annoy others who supported the Coalition's stance and see the ALP as compromised. The Member for Fremantle says Labor did not suffer in the polls after it differentiated itself from the Coalition in 1996 and 1998. \"We committed to native title, we refused the extinguishment options that Howard put forward,\" she said. \"We indicated our willingness to give an official apology on behalf of the nation to the Stolen Generations and we didn't lose a single vote, in fact we came the nearest to winning an election after having been nearly obliterated in 1996.\" \n",
       "A senior Hamas official has said the radical Palestinian movement has decided to stop suicide bombings against Israel. He told the Agence France Presse news agency that Hamas had taken an internal decision to end what it calls \"martyrdom operations\", but it was not going to make an official declaration. The official refused to say what tactics the radical group would use in its avowed struggle to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land, or if it would revert to grisly attacks if Israel carries out more \"targeted\" killings, which have taken a heavy toll on Hamas operatives. \"We can't predict anything,\" the official said. An official from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement also said there had been a meeting of various Palestinian factions in the West Bank on Wednesday and that Hamas had informed them they were halting their operations. The suicide attacks triggered a massive Israeli armed response and sweeping international condemnation. The Fatah official, who likewise asked to remain anonymous, said Hamas had said it did not want to damage Palestinian national unity by carrying on with such operations. Hamas suicide bombers blew themselves up in Jerusalem and Haifa, in northern Israel, at the beginning of this month, killing 26 people and provoking the heaviest Israeli air raids against Mr Arafat's administration to date. Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon severed all ties with Mr Arafat last week after another Hamas attack, which used gunmen and roadside explosives rather than suicide bombings. Mr Arafat in turn ordered the closure of dozens of Hamas offices and has started arresting its militants. A senior Israeli Defence official was quoted by army radio on Tuesday as saying Hamas had shifted the focus in its guerrilla war against Israel, and now  planned to attack strategic targets rather than \"soft\" ones, such as public buses or crowded shopping areas. The defence source said the focus will be on attacking strategic buildings and senior Israeli officials. \n",
       "Foreign Minister Alexander Downer says the Commonwealth's democracy watchdog should put Zimbabwe formally on its agenda in the first step to possible suspension from the organisation. Mr Downer says ministers from the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) should review whether the reported violence and intimidation in Zimbabwe means it has violated the Commonwealth's code of good governance. CMAG ministers from Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Botswana, Britain, Canada, Malaysia and Nigeria will meet in London tomorrow for talks on Zimbabwe. In recent meetings, they have suspended both Fiji and Pakistan following military coups. However, their talks on the violent campaign of farm occupations in Zimbabwe have been restricted to informal discussions, as President Robert Mugabe's government holds power through recognised elections. Mr Downer also says the Commonwealth ministers should maintain pressure on President Mugabe to allow international observers to oversee presidential elections next March. \n",
       "Legal abortion in Tasmania is one step closer with the lower house of Parliament voting to change the state's abortion laws. After a marathon 16-hour debate,  the House of Assembly this morning passed by 15 votes to eight, a Private Member's Bill which would allow medically sanctioned abortions. Debate on the bill began at 11:30am AEDT yesterday and at 5:00am today Speaker Michael Polley declared a result. Just before 10:00pm, the Deputy Premier Paul Lennon, Police Minister David Llewellyn and Labor backbencher Steven Kons abstained from voting on the bill's second reading. Then came seven hours of debate on proposed amendments calling for further expert opinion, post procedure counselling, cooling off periods and calls to stop the bill being retrospective. But apart from an amendment to ensure a specialist assessment, and written consent for the procedure, the bill passed unchanged. The Legislative Council will begin debate on the bill at 9:00am today. \n",
       "England batsman Michael Vaughan has become just the seventh player in the history of Test cricket to be given out handling the ball. Vaughan was on 64 when he flicked the ball with his hand towards a fielder on the first day of the third and final Test against India at Bangalore. The Englishmen says he was disappointed in the appeal by the Indians, which he believes was not in the spirit of the game. \"In the laws, I shouldn't have done it, but I thought I was just helping out the fielders,\" he said. \"I feel a bit disappointed on their behalf, one of their players appealed, I'm not too sure who it was, but a bit disappointed really.\" England finished the opening day at 6 for 255. Mark Ramprakash was out for 58, he and Vaughan adding 113 for the fourth wicket after England was struggling at 3 for 93. Staff at the Woomera Detention Centre are still on red alert as a result of continuing disturbances involving detainees. A further eight buildings were set on fire overnight and a spokesman for Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock says damage from fires at the facility over the past month is now estimated at $2 million. He says six detention officers were injured during last night's disturbance, out of which four have returned to work. He says damage to the buildings ranged from minor to extensive. It is understood some detainees had helped staff extinguish fires last night. The spokesman says up to 300 detainees had tried to break through the main fence during last night's disturbance and tear gas was used to prevent any escape. \n",

The Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, says the 26-year-old from South Australia is still being held in custody by the United States aboard the USS Peleliu in the Arabian Sea. Mr Williams says the suspected Al Qaeda fighter will interrogated by a team of ASIO and Federal Police officers. \"What is proposed is that he will be interrogated by an ASIO/AFP team,\" he said. \"He was captured by the Northern Alliance team in a conflict situation. \"He's held in military custody and whatever is the appropriate practice in that context will be followed,\" Mr Williams said. \"I do not imagine that he will be offered legal representation in these present circumstances.\" \n",

US officials say they are still unsure whether suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden is in the region. The United States Government says it is still no closer to finding bin Laden and that for now, the US mission will stay focused in Tora Bora, even though local anti-Taliban fighters have pulled out, because they believe there are no Al Qaeda members left. Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz has discussed options for the military campaign beyond Afghanistan. \"I think the places that we're going to be looking at immediately beyond Afghanistan  first and foremost, those places where we think senior Al Qaeda might be trying to escape to,\" Mr Wolfowitz said. US forces have now captured 15 prisoners, but are not receiving useful information from them. In Afghanistan, local tribal leaders now believe bin Laden will not be captured. Mujaheddin returning from the mountains, say they have seen no Al Qaeda fighters and doubt they will find bin Laden. Hundreds of anti-Taliban troops are still scouring the hilltops for bin Laden loyalists, believed to be fleeing towards Pakistan. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council is still debating key issues in a resolution authorising a multinational force to help provide security in Afghanistan, just days before an interim government is scheduled to take power in the country. Around 100 British Royal Marine commandos are expected in Kabul this weekend to spearhead the force, but local leaders are still haggling over the total number of peacekeepers and the UN is trying to define their mandate. Britain will be leading the force, with contributions expected from several countries including Australia. \n",
       "The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) says it has already warned operators of piston-engined aircraft of the potential dangers of running engines with an overly lean fuel mixture. The recommendation is a key feature of the Transport Safety Bureau's main report into last year's fatal Whyalla Airlines crash in South Australia's Spencer Gulf. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau today released its report into the crash, which killed eight people in May last year. The report has ruled out pilot error, saying mechanical failures in both engines forced the pilot of the plane to ditch the aircraft. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority says it is already acting on four safety improvement recommendations, with further regulation changes due before the end of the year. The authority says it has also begun to encourage conservative fuel leaning. Other recommendations relating to operating and maintenance procedures for high powered piston engines and procedures for ditching aircraft are still to be investigated by CASA, before a formal response is released. Meanwhile, the husband of crash victim, Teresa Pawlik, says he is yet to digest the full report, but is relieved it has been completed. Wal Pawlik says he and his family are still coming to terms with the loss. \"You carry on don't you? I think it's been much more difficult for my daughters. That's about all I can say on that,\" he said. \n",
       "The Northern Territory's coroner has found that an Aboriginal boy who died in custody nearly two years ago should not have to be in detention. In February last year, the teenager died in hospital from compression of the neck after hanging himself in the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre. In his report, the coroner, Dick Wallace, said the 15-year-old was a lonely and negelected orphan who had been offending since he was 13. In January last year, the teenager was given a mandatory 28-day sentence for stealing stationery. However, the coroner said the boy had been eligible to undertake a diversionary program of victim-offender conferencing instead of being sent to detention. The court had not considered that option and neither the prosecutor nor the boy's lawyer had told the magistrate there was an alternative to a custodial sentence. \n",
       "Ansett's administrators are confident of paying out the entitlements of almost 5,000 workers who opted for redundancy when the airline collapsed last September. About 4,000 workers have been paid their entitlements overnight and it is expected another 800 will be paid out by the end of the week. Administrator Mark Mentha says Ansett's new owners will now decide how many of the remaining employees will be offered jobs, with the remainder to be paid redundancy packages next year. He says it was always hoped the money would be handed over before Christmas as some workers had been without payment for up to 12 weeks. \"We would've preferred these payments to have been made a month ago but just the difficulty, in terms of the sheer size of the redundancy programs being undertaken at Ansett and difficulties in negotiation that have prevailed and the complexity of the Federal Government scheme and getting it through the Federal Court has certainly made life difficult, but we're very pleased that the money started flowing yesterday,\" Mr Mentha said. \n",

Mr Lavarch, a former Labor attorney-general, says he is concerned ASIO could use the laws to detain people indefinitely. \"The government's yet to make its case - it's a very draconian power and if it is required in order to protect public safety, it's absolutely essential that there be important safeguards,\" he said. \n",

Mr Gibbons has told the commission, HIH chairman Ray Williams and finance director Dominic Federa were at  that meeting. Mr Gibbons said Mr Smith noted that if HIH was wound up on that date there would be a clear shortage of assets to pay creditors. He says the directors were told it was highly likely all creditors would not receive 100 per cent returns. The commission has also heard that the accountancy firm told the directors that even with HIH's restructuring plans there was potential for insolvency. \n",

Earlier this month, Lee was fined for giving New Zealand tailender Shane Bond an unsportsmanlike send-off during the third Test in Perth. Waugh says tailenders should not be protected from short-pitched bowling. \"These days you're earning big money, you've got a responsibility to learn how to bat,\" he said. \"I mean there's no times like 20 years ago when it was not professional and sort of a bowlers' code. \"These days you're professional, our batsmen work very hard at their batting and expect other tailenders to do likewise.\" Meanwhile, Waugh says his side will need to guard against complacency after convincingly winning the first Test by 246 runs. Waugh says despite the dominance of his side in the first Test, South Africa can never be taken lightly. \"It's only one Test match out of three, or six whichever way you want to look at it, so there's a lot of work to go,\" he said. \"But it's nice to win the first battle definitely, it gives us a lot of confidence going into Melbourne, you know, the big crowd there, we love playing in front of the Boxing Day crowd, so that will be to our advantage as well.\" South Africa begins a four-day match against New South Wales in Sydney on Thursday in the lead up to the Boxing Day Test. Veteran fast bowler Allan Donald will play in the warm-up match and is likely to take his place in the team for the second Test.

Trouble at the centre has entered day three, with a plume of smoke 20 metres high into the air and up to 100 metres across the compound this morning. Thirteen buildings were either destroyed or damaged by fire on Monday night. Overnight fires and rioting appeared to have abated just after midnight local time. Three fire crews, one ambulance and several police have attended the scene. A water cannon and three tear-gas canisters were used to subdue detainees, who throughout the night were thought to be chanting \"visa\". It is not known whether anyone has been injured or arrested overnight. The acting Immigration Minister, Daryl Williams, says the Government is not losing control of Woomera. He has told Channel Nine, vandalism is not going to get visas for the detainees. \"The detainees, who have been provided with very good facilities and who to our knowledge have absolutely no complaint about the facilities there, are engaging in this campaign of damaging and destroying buildings in order to put pressure on the Australian authorities to grant them a visa,\" he said. There is a plea for so-called high-risk detainees to be separated from the rest of the population ath the Woomera Detention Centre in the wake of continued disturbances there. South Australian Labor MP Lyn Breuer, whose electorate covers Woomera, says higher risk detainees must be separated from women and children at the centre. \"I think that will probably have to be the ultimate solution, we will have to send high risk detainees to other areas,\" she said. \"We can't keep them in an environment where there are young children there...it's all a very nasty situation and I have particular concerns for the people that are guarding them as well, because one of them is going to get hurt very badly, very soon.\" \n",
       "The Federal Government has called on Labor not to delay its plans to increase the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's (ASIO) powers to combat terrorism. Labor wants a parliamentary inquiry to be set up to examine proposals to significantly increase ASIO's powers to detain and interrogate suspects. Under proposed legislation to go before Parliament next year, ASIO would have the power to detain suspects for up to 48 hours without charge and legal representation. If the Opposition's push for an investigation is successful, that could postpone debate on the bill for up to several months. But Labor's spokesman on Home Affairs, John Faulkner, says the Opposition does not want to unnecessarily delay the proposed legislation. \"We want to make sure that it is dealt with quickly by the Parliament but we also want to make sure that these important and unprecedented new powers for ASIO get the most thorough public examination and airing that's possible,\" he said. Attorney-General Daryl Williams says the Government is relying on Labor not to obstruct the bill's passage. \"We're looking to Labor's support for this,\" he said. \"Labor has supported the counter terrorism proposals we put forward and we believe that this is an appropriate one for them to support as well.\" Meanwhile, the Federal Government is under pressure to release more details about plans to place armed security officers on domestic flights. The Police Federation and unions are criticising the Government's handling of security at Australia's airports. The Federal Government says armed air marshals will be on all domestic flights by Christmas, a move which has the Police Federation concerned. Chief executive Mark Burgess there are not enough details. \"We know very little about what is proposed, we know virtually nothing about the training that these people will be afforded,\" he said. Warren Bennett, from the Board of Airline Representatives, says he understands why the plans are being put in place, but says airlines are wary of the move. \"It's always a bit of a concern to the captain that there would be anyone with some sort of weapon on the plane,\" he said.

A sharp weakening in oil prices should also contribute. The IMF says growth in Australia is expected to reach 3.3 per cent in 2002 - stronger than this year, but half a percentage point lower than projected in its October outlook.

New York firefighters battled the blaze for four hours before bringing it under control. Fire officials say there were no reported injuries, but the cathedral's gift shop had been badly damaged and the sanctuary suffered some smoke and water damage. The fire started at around 6:30am on Tuesday, local time, in the church's gift shop, but around 200 firemen were able to stem the flames' spread, preventing major damage to the sanctuary itself. Thick black smoke and bright orange flames had billowed from the immense structure in north-western Manhattan, near the Columbia University campus. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown. Firefighter Robert Savarese, who was among the first to enter the church, said the main problem was visibility. \"We knew which direction the fire was coming from, and we just went toward it,\" he said. Mr Savarese was among a group of firemen inside the building when Third Division Deputy Chief Edward Dennehy, who was standing outside, noticed flames pouring out of the building's roof. \"The guys in side thought it was a small fire because they could not see through the thick smoke,\" Mr Dennehy said. \"The ceiling could have collapsed.\" The firefighters battling the blaze inside were pulled out, and the fire was subsequently attacked with thick fire hoses from atop a tall crane. \n",

Mr Szondy says he is pleased it was such a decisive victory. \"We're very happy that the members have voted so overwhelmingly in support of the ticket and it hasn't been cherry-picked,\" he said.

A spokesman for the department says the first fire was lit at about 11:00pm (ACDT) last night, after two earlier demonstrations about visa applications. He says detainees threw rocks, chairs and other objects in an effort to stop staff and local fire brigade officers from putting out the fires. The department estimates the damage bill from fire-related incidents at Woomera has reached more than $1.5 million since November 20.

Mr Williams also says the first group of 22 air security officers will have finished their training this weekend but he won't reveal when they will take to the air. US and Afghan forces scoured Afghanistan's eastern highlands for Osama bin Laden, as United States President George W Bush expressed certainty the terror suspect would be caught, even though his whereabouts remain a mystery. For the first time in two weeks, the Tora Bora battleground fell silent, as tribal forces claimed they had defeated bin Laden's Al Qaeda fighters defending a complex of caves and tunnels that served as their headquarters. US warplanes suspended their bombing raids at the request of a local commander whose US-backed forces were scouring the mountainous area for fleeing Al Qaeda members, according to the Pentagon, which said there were still pockets of resistance in the area. US commandos also were on the ground searching for bin Laden, though the US administration said it had no clue whether he was still in the area. \"A few days ago we believed he was in the area,\" Rear Admiral John Stufflebeem said in Washington. Asked where bin Laden was now, the Pentagon spokesman said, \"anybody's guess is the latest thinking\". But President Bush expressed certainty it was just a matter time before the United States catches up with the man accused of masterminding the September 11 attacks on US cities. \"We get all kinds of reports, that he's in a cave, that he's not in a cave; that he's escaped, that he hasn't escaped,\" he said. \"There's all kinds of speculation, but when the dust clears, we'll find out where he is and he will be brought to justice.\" \n",

       "Yasser Arafat has accused Israel of escalating violence by killing three Palestinians, including a child, one day after he called for an end to all anti-Israeli attacks. Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he was waiting for action and not \"empty promises\" from the Palestinian leader. He also accused Mr Arafat of \"doing nothing to prevent\" attacks, in a telephone call with French President Jacques Chirac, the Prime Minister's office reported. President Chirac, meanwhile, said Mr Arafat remains the only negotiating partner for Israel, in separate calls with Prime Minister Sharon and the Palestinian leader. A televised address late yesterday by Mr Arafat, in which he said the persistent attacks must end and that perpetrators would be punished, was hailed by United Nations Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen as \"a potential turning point in the search for an end to the violence\". But the largest Islamic radical group, Hamas, issued a statement vowing to continue its holy war and slamming his peace call as an invitation for Mr  Sharon to \"exterminate\" Palestinians. Mr Arafat has closed dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad offices in response to punishing Israeli air attacks and massive international pressure to jail Islamic extremists who have killed dozens of Israelis in attacks this month. But the violence has continued. Today, Palestinian gunmen launched their first ambushes, wounding three Jewish settlers, including a father and three-year-old boy, in two separate shootings in the West Bank. The Israeli Army, which during the day said there had been a marked drop in violence immediately following Mr Arafat's speech - killed three Palestinians in separate incidents. In the first, Israeli troops trying to arrest a wanted Hamas member in Hebron shot the suspect dead as he tried to flee a raid on his house in a Palestinian-controlled area of the West Bank town, Palestinian police said. After Mr Sharon cut off ties with Mr Arafat last week for failing to prevent successive attacks, Israel has said it will take security matters in the Palestinian territories into its own hands. Israeli troops operating in West Bank land nominally under Palestinian control near Nablus also shot dead a Palestinian security officer approaching an army post set up on self-rule territory. \n",

The national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing and Workers Union (AMWU), Doug Cameron, says the unions have done everything possible to resolve the dispute. \"If Qantas is not prepared to accept private arbitration, there is absolutely no alternative for these workers to take further industrial action, escalate the industrial action if necessary to ensure that they get a fair go from this company who seemed determined to crush them underfoot,\" he said. \n",
       "Australia has beaten South Africa by 246 runs in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval. Needing 375 for victory, the tourists were dismissed late in the second session on the final day for 128. Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne each took three wickets, while Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee picked up two apiece. Warne was named man of the match. Jacques Kallis was the major resistance for the Proteas, notching an unbeaten 65. But he was ably assisted by his number 10 and 11 batsmen, Makhaya Ntini and Nanti Hayward, who frustrated the Australians for the best part of two hours. Set 375 for victory and starting the day at 2 for 17, the task was made much harder when Boeta Dippenaar was on his way early this morning, caught at first slip by Shane Warne from the bowling of Glenn McGrath. Two balls later Neil McKenzie, top scorer in the the Proteas' first innings, was out leg before wicket not playing a shot to McGrath. Lance Klusener and Kallis shared in a 33-run partnership, before Klusener, on 18, edged Gillespie to Warne at first slip. Mark Boucher became the third duck of the innings, getting a glove to a ball down the leg-side, Adam Gilchrist completing Gillespie's second wicket. Captain Shaun Pollock scored 1 before he was brilliantly caught at silly point by Ricky Ponting, Warne's second victim. Claude Henderson lasted just four balls after the luncheon interval before popping a catch to Ponting, his fifth for the match, at silly point from Warne's bowling. From there it seemed the match would be over in a matter of minutes, with Ntini and Hayward not expected to offer much resistance. But Ntini batted for more than an hour for his four runs, sharing with Kallis in the highest partnership of the innings, 38 runs. But he fell to Brett Lee, a swinging yorker deflecting off his pads and crashing into the stumps. Hayward also proved a menace to the Australians, taking more than half an hour for his 12 runs before he was caught behind from Lee's bowling and the innings was over. His innings was not without incident though, a Lee yorker crashing into his toes, sending him to the ground for a lengthy examination of the injury. He was out three balls later. Australia is now 1-0 in the best of three series. The next Test starts on Boxing Day at the MCG. \n",

The Dun and Bradstreet survey has identified positive projections for sales, profits, investment and employment. Of the organisations questioned by Dun & Bradstreet during November, 48 per cent were looking for an increase in sales in the first quarter of the new year. Twenty per cent were planning to take on extra staff compared with 15 per cent who said they had been shedding labour. Profit projections are well up, while investment intentions have improved slightly. The survey has also found companies are finding it significantly easier to comply with the goods and services tax (GST). \n",
       "At least four people, including two policemen, have been killed during an attempted coup in Haiti overnight. Armed commandos had stormed the national palace in the Haitian capital after midnight, local time and seized control of radio communications equipment. The attackers, understood to be former members of the Haitian military, fired at security guards as they entered the palace - the official residence of President Jean Bertrand Aristide. But the President was at another home in the capital Port-au-Prince during the attack. It is understood some of the gunmen have been arrested and the Haitian Government says it is now back in control. President Aristide was deposed in a coup 10 years ago, but was returned to power in 1994 after a United States invasion. He was recently re-elected for five years. \n",

Shadow Environment Minister Kelvin Thomson says better deterrents are needed to prevent further spills. \"One of the problems with oil spills appears to be a lack of prosecution action and I believe that it is important that people who recklessly or negligently cause oil spills, which seriously damage the environment are subject to prosecution action,\" he said. \n",
       "The United States Space Shuttle Endeavour has touched down at Florida's Kennedy Space Centre after a 12 day mission, bringing home a crew that had been on the International Space Station since August. The shuttle, carrying outgoing space station commander Frank Culbertson and Russian cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, along with four other astronauts, landed at 12.55pm local time. Taking over from the trio are Russian commander Yuri Onufrienko and US astronauts Carl Walz and Dan Bursch, who travelled to the station aboard Endeavour on December 5. Earlier Monday, the seven US and Russian astronauts on board Endeavour woke up to the tune Please Come Home for Christmas, by the rock group Bon Jovi. On Sunday, the Endeavour crew deployed a small satellite called Starshine 2 from a canister located in the shuttle's payload bay. More than 30,000 students from 26 countries will track the satellite as it orbits earth for the next eight months. The students will collect information in order to calculate the density of the upper atmosphere, NASA said. On Saturday, Endeavour undocked from the space station after making a last-minute maneuver to dodge a piece of Soviet-era space refuse. The Endeavour mission, the 12th shuttle trip to the International Space Station, brought some three tonnes of equipment and materials for scientific experiments to the station. The trip, carried out under extremely tight security, was the first since the September 11 attacks on the United States. \n",

More than 40 people were arrested. Mr McGauran says guards and police quickly had the situation under control. \"We won't be rushed into any change of security procedures, because we know we have very strong security,\" he said. \"It was really a decision by the guards at the time to make a risk assessment, and they decided these demonstrators, particularly given their large numbers, could not be stopped. \"But quickly New South Wales police could be called,\" he said. \n",
       "US forces backed by their Afghan allies are pursuing hundreds of Al Qaeda militants who have fled into the mountains after losing their bases near Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan. Local Afghan commanders say the militants have been flushed out of all their cave hideouts by weeks of heavy American bombing and a decisive ground assault. But American defence officials have been more cautious, saying the fight is far from over. They say up to 2,000 Al Qaeda members are on the run. The U-S has conceded that the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden remain a mystery despite reports that his Al Qaeda network appears close to defeat in Afghanistan. A  Yemeni man who surrendered says saw bin Laden in the area 10 days ago. Senior officials say they are certain that bin Laden was in the Tora Bora mountains in eastern Afghanistan and point to bin Laden's distinctive voice being heard on a hand held radio. Local Afghan commanders say they have overrun all the Al Qaeda caves. However the head of the US Central Command, General Tommy Franks, says it will take some time to confirm reports that Al Qaeda fighters are on the run. \"We are in fact with these opposition force commanders down in the vicinity of Tora Bora,\" he said. \"They are making progress, but I think it's accurate to say that it's going to be a while before we have the area of Tora Bora fully under control,\" he said. \n",
       "Qantas has moved to assure travellers there will be no disruption to flights over the Christmas period, despite threats of industrial action. Qantas maintenance workers have rejected the airline's proposals for a wage freeze. As negotiations over the dispute continue in the Industrial Relations Commission, Qantas Chief Executive Geoff Dixon has expressed his disappointment at the maintenance workers' actions. Mr Dixon points out 92 per cent of the airline's workforce have already agreed in-principle to accept a wages freeze together with an incentives scheme. Mr Dixon claims maintenance workers earn, on average, 28 per cent above average weekly earnings and also receive generous staff travel benefits. Mr Dixon has assured nervous travellers that even if the workers do go out on strike, Qantas flights will not be disrupted. Maintenance unions are refusing to soften their stance against a Qantas wage freeze proposal. Qantas and two maintenance unions are continuing negotiations in the Industrial Relations Commission, where unions produced a leaked airline briefing paper which says Qantas is prepared to escalate the strike to force a resolution. \n",

A fire service spokesperson says the fire, which was brought under control within two hours, could have been an act of arson. The number of people staying in the hotel du Palais at the time the fire was not immediately known. The inferno began at around 3am in the elevator shaft of the six-storey hotel, next to the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris' first arrondissement, the centre of the French capital. The flames spread quickly via the shaft to the building's roof. Firemen helped several hotel guests to safety through the windows of their rooms. Two of the victims were found asphyxiated on the fifth floor. One of the injured was said to be in serious condition in hospital. According to police, one man was arrested at the scene and an inquiry has been opened. The theatre was undamaged. \n",
       "The condition of former Indonesian dictator Suharto has improved, a day after the 80-year-old former ruler was put on an intravenous drip and given oxygen to assist his breathing. Doctors performed a series of tests early today and said Suharto's condition had picked up slightly since yesterday. \"He is still attached to an IV drip, but the doctors said 'Bapak' (father's) condition is much better than yesterday's,\" a staff member told AFP on the condition of anonymity. \"The doctors are still talking to his  children,\" he said. Suharto fell ill on Sunday when he and his family received some 100 visitors, including ex-ministers and former vice presidents at his family house for celebrations to mark the Muslim festival of Eid-al-Fitr. The former president ruled Indonesia for 32 years before he was forced from office in 1998. He has been fitted with a pacemaker and suffered at least one slight stroke as well as periodic breathing and urinary complications. He underwent an emergency appendectomy on February 24 this year. The staff said doctors had planned on hospitalising Suharto on Sunday, but Monday's test result showed he could be treated at home. \"His breathing rhythm is normal and unlike yesterday, he does not required an oxygen mask,\" the staff member added. Suharto has been charged with embezzlling 5.775 trillion rupiah ($AUD1.102 billion) of public funds during his time in office. But he has repeatedly failed to appear in court to answer the charges with his lawyers arguing that he is too ill to stand trial. \n",
       "The new Solomon Islands Prime Minister has told his people that there are tough times ahead. Sir Allan Kemakeza, the parliamentary leader of the People's Alliance Party, was elected Prime Minister on the first ballot. Sir Allan heads up a team consisting of the surviving members of the outgoing government and a large grouping of newly elected independents. One of those held one of the most senior positions in the Malaita Eagle Force militia that conducted last year's coup, while others who have backed him were elected after being endorsed by the rival Guadalcanal militia, the Isatabu Freedom Movement. That ethnic conflict has left the Solomons economy close to collapse and hundreds of high powered guns remain with the militants. Sir Allan is putting his trust in God. \"The times ahead are not going to be easy,\" he said. \"These will be times of sacrifice.\" Sir Allan says that he also hopes to get agreement on disarming rival militias in the country within his first 100 days in office, in an attempt to remove any remaining high powered weapons from the community. He believes it was his contacts with the grass root militias on both sides of the ethnic war that led to the success of the Townsville Peace conference that brought the war to a halt. Sir Allan, a former policeman, says the police force, part of which took part in last year's coup, needs to be overhauled. \"Both must go together, the disarmament program as well as the restructuring of the police force,\" he said. He says law and order will be one of his government's priorities. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's call for an end to attacks on Israelis has been met with a mixture of hope, scepticism and defiance. Under enormous international pressure to halt the violence, Mr Arafat has called for a halt to all armed operations against Israel, including suicide bombings, and vowed that the perpetrators would be punished. France, Britain and the United States have welcomed the announcement. The Israeli Cabinet Minister, Ephraim Sneh, says while it is a positive sign, the Palestinian Authority has to act on its words. \"If he proves that he really means to act very very forcefully, sincerely, effectively, and seriously against the Islamic Jihad and Hamas and his own Tanzin movement that will be a positive sign,\" he said. \n",

Chasing 375 for victory, the Proteas are 2 for 17 at stumps, with openers Hershelle Gibbs and Gary Kirsten back in the pavilion. Gibbs was out for 9 after chipping Glenn McGrath to Justin Langer at short leg. Then on the last ball of the day, Shane Warne picked up the wicket of Kirsten, caught at silly point by Ricky Ponting, for 7. An impressive century to Matthew Hayden helped Australia build a big lead, the home side declaring its second innings at 7 for 309, an overall lead of 374. Hayden and Mark Waugh shared a 181-run partnership for the third wicket, ensuring South Africa would be chasing a big target. Hayden scored 131 before he was bowled by Kallis, attempting to lift the run rate. His innings came from 207 balls, including 12 fours and four sixes. Waugh scored 74, before a top edge ballooned into the air and was safely taken by wicket keeper Mark Boucher to give Claude Henderson his first wicket. Adam Gilchrist was out for 22, caught on the square-leg boundary by Neil McKenzie to give Jacques Kallis his third wicket. Captain Steve Waugh followed shortly after, caught by his opposite number, Shaun Pollock, from Henderson's bowling, for 13. Shane Warne was the last wicket to fall, clean bowled by Henderson, for 6. \n",
       "The hunt for Osama bin Laden has shifted to the forests around the cave complex of Tora Bora after a swoop through the last caves failed to reveal any sign of the Saudi-born fugitive. US special forces are now combing the forests alongside anti-Taliban militias. Up to 500 Al Qaeda fighters are believed to have scattered into the hills, many heading south toward the Pakistan border. Local commanders have warned they will shoot any villager who shelters them. US bombing runs have eased off in the past 12 hours as American special forces move to deeper into the forest to coordinate the hunt. Earlier, US forces intercepted a voice communication they believed could be bin Laden speaking by short range radio to his fighters. However, a senior Afghan commander, Haji Zaman, said he believed bin Laden had left the Tora Bora area. US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, on a visit to US troops at Baghram air base outside Kabul, said the battle against the Taliban and Al Qaeda was not over. \"There are still pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda forces that have drifted into the mountains and could reform and there is a good deal yet to be done,\" he said. \n",
       "Israel has reacted with caution to a promise from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to hunt down suicide bombers and end armed attacks against Israeli targets. Mr Arafat made the commitments during a speech broadcast on Palestinian television. The Palestinian leader said Israel was using suicide attacks as a pretext for waging war on Palestinians and that such operations were therefore against Palestinian national interests. Israel will be looking to see whether Mr Arafat is offering anything more than words. He has promised to round up suicide bombers before but very few in fact have been arrested. Mr Arafat said peace was the only way of resolving the conflict and that the changed world situation since the attacks in the United States on September 11 had to be taken into account. The United States Government says it is keenly watching to see whether Mr  Arafat's actions match his words. The White House says it will continue to engage in the peace process, despite the withdrawal of its Middle East envoy. The Bush administration says the Palestinians are more to blame than the Israelis for the current disarray in the peace process, primarily because of Mr Arafat's inability to control terrorists in his ranks. Secretary of State Colin Powell says it is time for Mr Arafat to exert control. \"But as President Bush said the other day and we have been saying repeatedly, as leader, he has to lead he has to act like a leader,\" he said. The White House says it will continue to play a role in the Middle East and expects its envoy General Anthony Zinni to return when he can play a productive role. \n",

The editor of a British tabloid has defended the resumption of its name and shame campaign against paedophiles saying parents have the right to know of potential dangers in the community. The paper published the names of convicted paedophiles who had failed to submit their names to the sex offenders register. The News of the World created uproar last year when it published the names and addresses of child sex offenders with vigilante groups formed and in some cases attacking the wrong men. The latest campaign, which is limited to naming those who have absconded without registering, comes in the wake of the conviction of known paedophile Roy Whiting for the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne. News of the Worl editor Rebekah Wade says it is the public's right to know. \"If you have paedophiles in society that aren't monitored, they will strike again,\" she said. \"If the police cannot monitor them, then it is only right and fair if you have a family with three young children then you have a general right to know that to protect your children.\" British Home Secretary David Blunkett has promised more community involvement in the supervision of known offenders. \n",

In the videotape lasting roughly one hour bin Laden explains planning aspects of the operation and his own calculations in advance concerning the scale of the damage to the World Trade Center in New York and the number of casualties. He said he expected the fire and gas from the attacks on the World Trade Center to topple the floors above the points where hijacked planes struck, not the entire structure. \"We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy who would be killed based on the position of the tower,\" he said, according to a transcript translated into English from the Arabic. \"Due to my experience in this field, I was thinking that the fire from the gas in the plane would melt the iron structure of the building and collapse the area where the plane hit and all the floors above it only,\" he said. \"That is all that we had hoped for.\" The video tape showed bin Laden speaking to supporters in a room, possibly in Kandahar in mid-November, the Pentagon said in releasing the amateur videotape, which it said was made with the knowledge of bin Laden and those present. The tape showed the end of the meeting first, followed by an unrelated segment of videotaped material, and ending with a segment recorded at the beginning of the meeting. \"We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day,\" he said, speaking to unidentified sheikh. \"We had finished our work that day and had the radio on, It was 5:30 pm our time. I was sitting with Dr. Ahmad Abu-al-(Khair),\" he said. \"Immediately, we heard the news that a plane had hit the World Trade Center.\" \"After a while, they announced that another plane had hit the World Trade Center.

In Ramallah in the West Bank, also hit by missiles less than 24 hours earlier, rocket strikes sent clouds of flames and smoke in the air over a ruined police station close to the centre of the town, which has been partly reoccupied by Israeli tanks. The police station was bombed last October after a Palestinian mob lynched two Israeli soldiers there. Large parts of Ramallah were plunged into darkness after the raid. In Jenin to the north, US-made Apaches blasted a building of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement, witnesses said. Earlier, Israeli troops shot eight Palestinian children near the Rafah border crossing with Egypt in the southern Gaza Strip, killing one, Palestinian  hospital officials said. Israel had said it would send its forces into Palestinian self-rule areas to track down militants Mr Arafat has failed to arrest despite huge international pressure and more than a week of repeated air strikes. Late Wednesday local time, following the bus ambush which killed 10 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, F-16s blasted security targets in Gaza City, Nablus and Gaza international airport. Apache helicopters also hit a Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation station in Ramallah, and tanks and army bulldozers moved in yesterday to plough the remains into the ground and dynamite the radio mast, a symbolic blow against Mr Arafat's increasingly shaky authority. Israel's right-wing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, with the backing of a security cabinet dominated by nationalists, declared Mr Arafat \"irrelevant\" after Islamic and secular Palestinian militants carried out the bus ambush. Israel said Mr Arafat had forfeited his role as a peace partner by refusing to crack down on Islamic hardliners. \"I think we are close as we've ever been to a full military confrontation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority,\" UN Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen warned. \"Undoubtedly if that happens this will either, in the best case, weaken the institutions of the Palestinian Authority so much that there will be very little central authority, or the Palestinian Authority will be completely crushed,\" he said. \n",
       "The Australian and South African sides for the first cricket Test starting at the Adelaide Oval today are not expected to be finalised until just before the start of play. Australian captain Steve Waugh and his South African counterpart, Shaun Pollock, will decide on their lineups after an inspection of the pitch shortly before the start of play. The match holds special significance for Waugh and his twin brother Mark, who play their 100th Test together. Steve Waugh is not placing too much relevance on the milestone. \"[I] don't want to read too much into it I guess and then get too carried away but later on when we retire and look back on it it will be significant. \"It's nice for the family, mum and dad all the sacrifices they made you know with us growing up and also our brothers so you know it's nice for the family,\" he said. \n",
       "The Federal Government is negotiating with the United States and other countries about the fate of an Adelaide man suspected of fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan. David Hicks, 26, was captured by Northern Alliance forces three days ago, and is now in the custody of American troops. The head of the Victorian Law Institute, John Corcoran, says Mr Hicks could face a charge of treason under Australian law, the only crime punishable by death. \"If the circumstances are permitted, he could be charged with treason under the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which does have the death penalty,\" he said. If charged under the Foreign Incursion Act, the penalty is less severe carrying a maximum 14-year jail sentence. But the Defence Minister, Robert Hill, says it is too early to say whether the Government will take legal action. \"These issues are being looked at, but he was only captured a few days ago and it's difficult to ascertain all the facts,\" Senator Hill said. The Government is currently holding talks with the United States about Mr Hicks' fate. The Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister, Kevin Rudd, has urged the Government to set up immediate diplomatic access to the suspected Taliban fighter. Mr Rudd says consular officials must start to try and establish the facts about the 26-year-old who has been arrested by the Northern Alliance. The Australian Government is trying to ascertain whether he has broken any Australian laws but says he could also be a prisoner of war in Afghanistan. Mr Rudd, who is in the Pakistan capital Islamabad, says if a diplomatic presence is not available, there are other means. \"For example, International Council of Red Cross I understand from sources here in Islamabad, is assisting in providing access to individuals currently held by the Northern Alliance of varying nationalities,\" Mr Rudd said. \n",
       "The Israeli Government has declared Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat irrelevant and has decided to break off all contacts with him. The dramatic move followed a Palestinian ambush on a bus carrying Israeli settlers in the West Bank, that killed 10 people, and a double suicide attack in the Gaza Strip, that injured four Israelis. In response, Israeli jets and helicopters have attacked Palestinian targets across the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The Israelis say they hold Mr Arafat directly responsible for the latest incidents and will have nothing to do with him. The Government position was spelt out by spokesman Raanan Gissin. \"In no way does it imply or was there any directive to hurt to harm or to expel Arafat personally,\" he said. \"We are not attacking Arafat personally, we don't have a quarrel with Arafat the person. \"We have a real quarrel and a real fight and struggle against terrorism, against Arafat when he represents terrorism, when he support terrorism.\" \n",
       "The Federal Opposition says the unemployment rate has fallen because many job seekers have given up looking for work. Employment Minister Tony Abbott says there is a degree of volatility in the labour market with a significant increase in October's figures and a significant fall in the November unemployment rate. But Mr Abbott says the latest figures are encouraging and he is not overly concerned by a reduction in the number of people looking for work. \"From month to month these figures bounce around, but the participation rate even with this month's drop is still at high historical records,\" he said. Labor leader Simon Crean says 4,000 jobs were created last month, but 32,000 people stopped searching for work. \"The unemployment rate hasn't come down because jobs are being created, it has come down because people have given up on looking for jobs.\" \n",
       "Industrial action will affect three of Australia's biggest banks over the next two days. Banking staff at Westpac and the National Australia Bank are striking today for 24 hours, while workers at ANZ will follow suit tomorrow. The action by members of the Finance Sector Union has been timed to coincide with the banks' annual general meetings and is part an ongoing enterprise bargaining negotiations. The union's Geoff Derrick says the strike is not just about  pay. \"Certainly pay's in there, it needs to be but the key issue for us has been around workloads. \"We've got a million hours of overtime being worked a week in this industry [and] most of it is unpaid,\" Mr Derrick said. Westpac's David Lording says today's action is unjustified. \"We have an 8 per cent pay increase over two years for all eligible staff on the table, it's a very generous pay offer. \"We would also like to introduce a number of other initiatives that will assist our staff balance in particular their work and family life, we would like to do a deal with the union,\" Mr Lording said. \"What we would like is for the union to come back to the negotiating table rather than continuing on with these PR stunts.\" Mr Lording says there are contingency plans in place to ensure branches can stay open. \"We are hoping to offer normal banking services for our customers,\" he said. \n",
       "Senior Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) officials giving evidence at the Royal Commission into the Building Industry have been overwhelmed by support from union members. About 700 construction workers have walked off the job for the third day to demonstrate outside the commission venue. Mounted police escorted the protesters from Melbourne's City Square to Collins Place. Morning traffic ground to a halt at the intersection of Russell and Collins streets when the crowd stopped to chant union slogans. CFMEU Victorian secretary Martin Kingham says he has been astounded by the strong support shown by union members on each day of the hearings. He maintains the union has been treated unfairly as it faces allegations of intimidation and using standover tactics on work sites. Mr Kingham is currently giving evidence before the commission. It is the last day of hearings before the Christmas break. The Labor leader, Simon Crean, says senior Labor figures Bob Hawke and Neville Wran will be used to help modernise the party. Labor's national executive is meeting in Canberra. Mr Crean will put his views on the changes Labor needs to make. The executive is expected to ask Mr Hawke and Mr Wran to oversee the process. Mr Crean says they know what needs to be done. \"Bob Hawke and Neville Wran understood the importance of modernising the party and that's why they were successful leaders of the country. \"I'm sure we don't need to teach them to suck eggs, what I want them to do is to give us guidance as to how we can bring the new approach to Labor in 2002 to enable us to properly present and gain the confidence of the majority of the Australian people,\" the Opposition leader said. \n",
       "The mind games are continuing as Australia and South Africa have their final hit-outs in the lead-up to the first cricket Test beginning in Adelaide tomorrow. Shane Warne says he is looking for a new batsman to dominate following Daryl Cullinan's non-selection, while Proteas batsman Jacques Kallis says there is no Australian bowler good enough to get him out. Australian paceman Glenn McGrath begs to differ. He believes he will return to his best against South Africa if he can keep the form he had late in the series against New Zealand. McGrath says he was happier with the way he bowled as the series went on, as the rain that dogged the series also meant there were not as many chances to take wickets. \"It would have been nice to get a few more nicks. I felt great in myself, the rhythm's back, I'm bowling long spells and everything's going well,\" he said. \"It's just I didn't get the wickets I would have liked, so hopefully they'll come in this series.\" He says the Australian and South African sides are at level pegging, but the Proteas have more to prove. \"There's probably more pressure on South Africa. We're the number one side at the moment, they have to actually beat us. \"They're not the underdogs going into the series and there should be some good, hard cricket played out in the middle but the pressure's probably on them rather than us.\" Israeli warplanes have bombed Gaza City security buildings close to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's offices, in swift revenge for a deadly ambush on an Israeli bus, Palestinian security officials said. The planes hit naval police offices and the police headquarters which was already flattened in air raids last Thursday, officials said. The other targets were not immediately identified. Palestinian hardliners had earlier killed 10 Israelis in an attack on an Israeli bus in the West Bank, while two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a  Gaza Strip Jewish settlement, injuring four Israelis at the same time. Israel launched almost simultaneous retaliatory strikes on Nablus, a town close to the scene of the bus ambush. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat immediately closed down all institutions belonging to the militant Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups after the bus ambush. \"The Palestinian Authority in an urgent meeting headed by Mr Arafat has taken a decision that Palestinian security forces will immediately close down all Hamas and Islamic Jihad institutions, including education, health and political offices,\" an official statement said. The Palestinian Authority earlier condemned the Palestinian attack on the bus near the Jewish settlement of Immanuel in the West Bank in which 10 people were killed, and two suicide bombings in the Gaza Strip in which three people were wounded. The US special envoy to the Middle East, Anthony Zinni, told Mr Arafat to jail extremists \"immediately\" after the bus ambush. \"Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must move immediately to arrest those responsible for these attacks and destroy the infrastructure of terror organisations that support them,\" the retired Marine Corps general said in a statement. A radical offshoot of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, the Al-Aqsa Brigades, said in a statement that it and Hamas were jointly responsible for the attack, in a statement received by the AFP news agency. Ezzedin al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, earlier claimed responsibility for the bus ambush, the television station run by Lebanon's Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah reported. An Israeli Defence Ministry spokesman, in a statement received by AFP, said the attack was carried out by Hamas militants whose names figured on a list of 33 activists wanted by Israel. Israel last week said it gave the list to Mr Arafat. \n",
       "At least two helicopters have landed near Tora Bora mountain in eastern Afghanistan, in what could be the start of a raid against Al Qaeda fighters, an AFP journalist said. The helicopters landed around 11:00pm local time (5:30am AEDT), a few hours after Al Qaeda fighters rejected a deadline set by Afghan militia leaders for them to surrender or face death. US warplanes have been bombing the network of caves and tunnels for eight days as part of the hunt for Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Several witnesses have spoken in recent days of seeing members of US or British special forces near the frontline between the local Afghan militia and the followers of bin Laden. They could not be seen but could be clearly heard as they came into land and strong lights were seen in the same district. US B-52 bombers and other warplanes staged a series of attacks on the Al Qaeda positions in the White Mountains after bin Laden's fighters failed to surrender. All four crew members of a US B-1 bomber that has crashed in the Indian Ocean near Diego Garcia have been rescued, US military officials said. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Timothy Taylor, said initial reports said that all four were aboard the destroyer USS Russell which was rushed to the scene after the crash. The B-1 bomber, which usually carries a crew of four and is armed with bombs and cruise missiles, was engaged in the air war over Afghanistan. Pentagon officials said they had heard about the crash just after 5:30am (AEDT) and were unable to say whether the plane was headed to Diego Garcia, or flying from the Indian Ocean island. It is thought the Australian arrested in Afghanistan for fighting alongside the Taliban is from Adelaide's northern suburbs but the Salisbury Park family of 26-year-old David Hicks is remaining silent. The president of Adelaide's Islamic Society, Walli Hanifi, says Mr Hicks approached him in 1999 having just returned from Kosovo, where he had developed an interest in Islam. He says Mr Hicks wanted to know more about the faith, but left after a few weeks. Late yesterday afternoon, Mr Hicks' Salisbury Park family told media the Australian Federal Police had told them not to comment. Local residents confirmed a member of the family called Mr Hicks had travelled to Kosovo in recent years and has not been seen for around three years. But most, including Karen White, agree they cannot imagine Mr Hicks fighting for a terrorist regime. \"Not, unless he's changed now, but when he left here, no he wasn't, he's just a normal teenage, adult boy,\" she said. But a man known as Nick, told Channel Ten he is sure the man detained in Afghanistan is his friend David. He says in 1999 David told him about training in the Kosovo Liberation Army. \"He'd gone through six weeks basic training, how he'd been in the trenches, you know, killed a few people, you know confirmed kills and had a few of his mates killed as well,\" the man said. \n",
       "Australia and the United Nations have openly clashed in Geneva, over how best to deal with asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. At a refugee conference, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has rejected criticism of Australia's strong stand on asylum seekers from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers. Mr Lubbers says some government leaders base their refugee policies on fear and mistrust, instead of cooperating to share the burden. In a speech at the beginning of the meeting, Mr Ruddock rejected that criticism. Australia has a very fine record,\" he said. \"We are a generous contributor to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' budget. \"When burden sharing is requested, we respond. \"We honour our obligations to those people who are refugees and those who seek asylum in Australia.\" Mr Ruddock alsosaid the 50-year old convention could be at risk because of its overly legalistic system which gives too many favours to asylum seekers. \n",
       "The former managing director of One.Tel has denied claims he mislead the board while the company was effectively insolvent. Jodee Rich says civil proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) against him, two other former directors and the former chairman, are baseless. ASIC claims that the true financial position of One.Tel was not made known to the other directors of the company. However, Mr Rich says there are discrepancies in the way ASIC has handled the investigation. \"I am concerned that as part of this process ASIC has not given us the opportunity to respond to the many claims that they alleged six months ago and that we haven't had an opportunity to respond to these claims that they are now bringing to us,\" he said. \n",

       "A British man has been found guilty by a unanimous verdict of the kidnap and murder of an eight-year-old schoolgirl whose death in July 2000 shocked Britain and set off a rampage of anti-paedophile vigilantes. Roy Whiting was sentenced to life imprisonment for the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne with a recommendation by trial judge Justice Richard Curtis that he never be released. \"You are indeed an evil man. You are in no way mentally unwell. I have seen you for a month and in my view you are a glib and cunning liar,\" Justice Curtis said. There were cheers of delight as the verdicts were read out by the foreman at Lewes Crown Court. The jury of nine men and three women had been deliberating for nine hours. As soon as the verdicts were declared, the court heard details of Whiting's previous conviction for the kidnap and indecent assault of a nine-year-old girl in 1995. Prosecutor Timothy Langdale told the jury how the defendant threw the child into the back of his dirty red Ford Sierra and locked the doors. \"He had driven her somewhere. She didn't know where. When she asked where they were going he said, 'shut up', because he had a knife,\" Mr Langdale said. \"The defendant told the girl to take off her clothes. When she refused, he produced a rope from his pocket and threatened to tie her up. \"What he actually threatened was that he would 'tie her mouth up'. \"She took her clothes off as he had ordered her to do.\" Mr Langdale then gave graphic details of the abuse to which Whiting subjected the terrified child. Whiting was given a four-year jail sentence in June 1995 after admitting carrying out the attack in March that year. But he was released in November 1997 despite warnings from probation officers, who were convinced there was a danger he would attack another child. They set out their warnings in a pre-sentence report, prepared after the first assault, and in the parole report before he was released from prison. He was kept under supervision for four months after his release, but was not being monitored by July last year, when eight-year-old Sarah was abducted and killed. Whiting has been arrested three times in connection with the case, but the first and second times was released without being charged. Sarah disappeared on July 1 last year, prompting a massive police search. Her partially-buried naked body was found 16 days later in a field and police believe she was strangled or suffocated. \n",
       "The AFL's leading goal kicker, Tony Lockett, will nominate for the pre-season draft after all. Lockett approached the Sydney Swans about a return to the game last week but after much media speculation, decided it was not in the best interests of his family to come out of retirement. Today, the 35-year-old changed his mind. He has informed the Swans of his intention to nominate for next Tuesday's pre-season draft. In a statement released a short time ago, Lockett says last week he felt rushed and did not feel comfortable with his decision.

Sydney says it is delighted Lockett has decided to make a return and it intends to draft him. \n",
       "The Pentagon believes it has finally confirmed the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden to an area in eastern Afghanistan where the search had been focusing. The United States Air Force dropped a 6,800 kilogram bomb called the Daisy Cutter into the mountains of the Tora Bora region two days ago. It wreaked havoc in the caves and tunnels of the Al Qaeda hideout and prompted a flurry of communications. The United States intercepted those communications and the Pentagon now believes Osama bin Laden is on the run in those mountains and many of his fighters were seriously injured by the blast. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Richard Myers, said the bomb was effective. \"I don't want to go into details, it would have had the desired effect.\" The United States has now deployed gunships along the Pakistani border to try and stop Osama bin Laden crossing into Pakistan. \n",
       "A French Moroccan man has been charged in the United States with conspiracy in the terrorist attacks of September 11. It is the first indictment directly related to the suicide hijackings. News of the charge came as President George W Bush delivered a major foreign policy speech. Zaccarias Moussaoui sought flying lessons a month before the hijackings. Attorney-General John Ashcroft claims he was an active participant in the attacks. \"Moussaoui is charged with undergoing the same training, receiving the same funding and pledging the same commitment to kill Americans as the hijackers,\" he said. Three months to the day since the attacks and President Bush says missile defence is now more essential than ever before. \"We must protect America and our friends against all forms of terror, including the terror that could arrive on a missile,\" he said.

       "Australian families of the victims from the Interlaken tragedy have welcomed today's guilty verdicts against six employees from the Adventure World canyoning tour company. A Swiss court has found the six of the eight employees guilty of culpable manslaughter after the tragedy which killed 21 people, 14 of them Australians. They have been given suspended jail sentences of up to five-months and fined between $5,000 and $7,000. Two guides who survived were acquitted. Gary Redmond, who lost his 26-year-old son Scott and 24-year-old daughter-in-law Alissa, says he is satisfied and relieved with the outcome. \"All along we hoped that justice would prevail and that whatever the penalties that apply in Switzerland that are appropriate should apply,\" Mr Redmond said. Some of the families are threatening civil action, but Mr Redmond says the verdict means closure for his family \"I'm not of the view that anything that now comes out of this whether there be any further benefit to accrue to us or the survivors, that it will in any way compensate for the loss of our loved ones,\" Mr Redmond said. The families say that they are still to receive an apology from Adventure World, but Bill Peel, whose son Billy died in the 1999 canyoning accident and is in Switzerland for the court hearing, has welcomed today's verdicts \"I always felt that they were guilty because the duty of care was never used...and now the judge has confirmed everything we believed,\" Mr Peel said. The family of a Bendigo woman killed in the canyon disaster has also welcomed the verdict. Kylie Morrow's mother Elizabeth, says the verdict has made the tour guides accountable for their negligence, and proves the young people who lost their lives did not act recklessly. \"I'm not sure where we go from here but you know we've got other children and we've got each other and family and life goes on even when you don't want it to sometimes. \"Our lives have been changed forever and nothing that happens from now on can be any worse than what we've been through,\" Ms Morrow said. \n",
       "The Federal Agriculture Minister, Warren Truss, says he has not been able to win any changes to the farm bill being debated by the United States Congress. Mr Truss has led a delegation of Australian farmers to Washington lobbying for some of the Government subsidies to farmers to be removed. He says he has not achieved any changes to the amount of Government protection for US farmers. Mr Truss says that will mean Australian farmers will suffer. \"We're especially concerned at the clear intent of the farm lobby to seek to entrench a mentality of farm subsidies in the USA. \"It is obvious that the US, which was once proudly boasted to be the most efficient farmers in the world, have now degenerated to a situation where US farmers are dependent on the taxpayers for around half their income,\" Mr Truss said. \n",
       "The secret Australian budget for the boat people pacific solution is set at $400 to $500 million. The estimate, approved by Cabinet in September when Nauru first agreed to house and process asylum seekers, was based on a joint submission from Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock, the Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, and the then defence minister, Peter Reith. It covered everything from the defence costs in transporting boat people to health care, camp construction and guarding asylum seekers. The participation of at least three government departments means the costs of setting up the boat people camp in Nauru can be allocated across different portfolios. Some of the first distribution of cash was used to meet Nauru's unpaid bills. Australia is pushing on with the Pacific solution, with agreement yesterday to boost the number of boat people places in Nauru from 800 people to 1,200. \n",

But he says he has had more extensive training than American John Walker Lindh who was arrested on December 1 for fighting with the Taliban. \"He is understood to have travelled to Europe in mid-1999 to join the Kosovo Liberation Army, he then travelled to Pakistan November 1999 where he undertook some training. \"He entered Afghanistan as we understand it in 2000 and he has actually undertaken extensive training with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network,\" Mr Williams said. \n",
       "Turning grief into defiance, Americans have paused in remembrance, three months after the deadly September 11 attacks, as a resolute President George W Bush forecast certain victory in his war on terrorism. At 8:46am New York time (12:46am AEDT), the exact moment when a hijacked airliner steered on a suicide mission sliced into one of the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, ceremonies in Washington, New York and around the world honoured some 3,300 people killed on an unprecedented day of horror. \"Today, the wrongs are being righted, justice is being done,\" Mr Bush said. \"We still have far to go, and many dangers still lie ahead, yet there can be no doubt how this conflict will end. In New York, firefighters, police officers and community leaders assembled in the wreckage-strewn crater where the World Trade Centre stood, until its signature towers were levelled on the bright sunny morning of September 11. Under grey skies, a lone tenor sung Let There Be Peace on Earth before a priest, a rabbi and an imam addressed a solemn crowd, watched by New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who shepherded his city through September's tragedy. Bagpipers performed a haunting rendition of Amazing Grace as cranes and the heavy machinery of construction workers excavating the site stood idle. At the Pentagon, the target of another hijacked airliner, a US flag was unfurled in front of a gaping hole in the building, where reconstruction is already under way. A lone Christmas tree, daubed with red lights, was fixed to the roof, metres from where the plane hit. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld vowed never to forget the 184 victims who died at the Pentagon, the thousands more killed in New York and on those on a hijacked plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania, apparently after the intervention of passengers. \"In the skies over Pennsylvania they showed those who believed that Americans would not fight back that they were ready to roll,\" Mr Rumsfeld said. The first person has been charged over the terrorist attacks in the United States three months ago. Zaccarias Moussaoui was charged in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks as a result of the wide-ranging federal probe of the attacks, United States Attorney-General John Ashcroft said. Moussaoui, 33, a French national of Moroccan origin, faces six counts in connection with the terrorists attacks against the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon outside Washington that left more than 3,000 people dead, Mr Ashcroft told a press conference. Four of those counts carry the death penalty. The indictment also cites a list of unindicted co-conspirators headed by Osama bin Laden, head of the Al Qaeda network, and Ayman al-Zawahiri, head of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, as unindicted co-conspirators. The list of co-conspirators also includes the 19 hijackers who commandeered the four jets that were used as aerial targets on September 11, as well as two men who sent funds to the alleged terrorists. \n",
       "Six Swiss tour company staff have been found guilty of manslaughter over the deaths of 14 Australians and seven others in a canyoning disaster. Two guides who survived the accident on July 27, 1999, were acquitted. Adventure World president Stephan Friedli, vice-president Peter Balmer and director Georg Hoedle were each given a five-month suspended sentence and a fine of 7,500 Swiss francs (about $A8,800). General manager Felix Oehler received five months and a fine of 5,000 francs, base manager Bernhard Gafner four months and 4,000 francs, and lead guide Bernhard Steuri three months and 4,000 francs. All six will pay one-eighth of the court costs and one-eighth of the plaintiffs' costs, about 27,000 francs each. Guides Simon Wiget and Stefan Abegglen were acquitted. Peter Dewar, whose son Bradley died in the 1999 disaster, says more legal action is planned. \"I guess if anything the main thing we were waiting for was a verdict of guilty or not guilty,\" Mr Dewar said. \"The guilty verdict at least leaves something open for civil action, we already have legal representation in place.\" Mr Dewar said he hopes civil action would be a further \"form of punishment for the guilty\". Bill Peel of Mackay in north Queensland, whose son Billy died in the canyoning accident, is disappointed with the verdict. \"It's Swiss law and we have to abide by it, I was very angry, very angry I couldn't believe it. \"We were told this when the lawyer came to Australia 18 months ago but it was still hard to believe it was true...oh well at least they are guilty and they have to live that the rest of their lives and that's some punishment anyway,\" Mr Peel said. \n",

A three-judge panel found the men guilty of killing two nuns, three priests and an Indonesian journalist, as well as carrying out other murders in East Timor's Los Palos district. They also found the gang members guilty of torture, persecution and forced deportation. The court heard how soon after the vote the militia gang members, still loyal to Indonesia, carried out 13 murders, burnt several villages and forced residents of Los Palos to flee their homes. They are the first people to be convicted of crimes against humanity in connection with the violence that surrounded East Timor's vote for independence. \n",
       "The United States Federal Reserve has cut a key interest rate by a quarter-point to a 40-year low of 1.75 per cent and left the door open to further easing to help bring the US economy out of recession. It was the 11th cut this year to the federal funds target rate and the fourth since the September 11 suicide attacks in New York and Washington. The key rate, which determines overnight borrowing costs between banks, is at its lowest level since July 1961. Policy makers also cut the discount rate, at which commercial banks can borrow from the Federal Reserve, by the same quarter-point margin to 1.25 per cent. \"Economic activity remains soft, with underlying inflation likely to edge lower from relatively modest levels,\" the Federal Open Market Committee said in a written statement. The US economy officially slid into a recession in March, ending an unprecedented 10-year expansion period. The terrorist shockwave has escalated the task of rebuilding growth, experts said. \n",
       "Drug education campaigns appear to be paying dividends with new figures showing a 10 per cent drop in drug related deaths last year. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1,570 people died from drug related causes in the year 2000. That figure is a substantial drop from 1999 when 1,740 Australians died of drug related causes. Across the states and territories, New South Wales recorded the biggest decrease. The bureau's David Payne attributes the decline of drug deaths to the heroin drought in some parts of the country, better equipped ambulances and emergency wards and above all, effective federal and state drug education campaigns. \"They have put a lot of money into the program. \"There has been a fall and while you can't discern a trend from that, the figures are going in the right way, right direction,\" Mr Payne said. \n",
       "The number of adults and children being diagnosed as obese is on the increase. The findings of a new study have worrying implications for the future of Australia's health system. The study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows the number of people diagnosed as either obese or overweight has increased by 2 per cent over the past two years. The institute's Statistics Unit director, professor Helena Britt, says the findings have grave implications. \"There seems to be a shift of 1 per cent going up and if we do that every year for the next 10 years we are in big trouble.\" Professor Britt says there has been a drop in deaths from heart disease over the past two decades, but if the rise in obesity continues it could reverse that trend, at a great cost to the community. Up to 12 per cent of Australia's children are also now obese. Professor Helena Britt says this is the first time there have been reliable statistics available to show the prevalence of obesity among children, using a new international standard. She says the results are frightening for the future health of Australia's adults. \"This is a worry for future heart disease because there has been research demonstrating a relationship between adult heart disease and childhood obesity so its something we have to watch as a society,\" she said. Nutrition Australia dietitian Rachael Bradford says the results, while disturbing, are not surprising. She says Australians need to look at lifestyle and resist the temptation of convenience food to avert the trend. \"I think it's got to do with our nation having less physical activity,\" Ms Bradford said. \"There's a lot of automation with Australia because we are such a privileged country so people are using automobiles, cars more, and not doing as much walking.\" \n",
       "United States peace envoy Anthony Zinni has told a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian security officials he had decided to continue his mission to end 15 months of bloodshed, US and Israeli sources said. On Sunday, Mr Zinni walked out of an Israeli-Palestinian security meeting and gave both sides 48 hours to show they were serious about halting violence. \"Zinni said he was responding favourably to requests to continue his mission,\" an Israeli security source said, describing today's US-hosted meeting as positive. A US diplomatic source told the Reuters news agency: \"Zinni is continuing his mission\". Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Mr Zinni yesterday and urged him to continue a two-week-old mission marred by constant violence, including Palestinian suicide bombings and retaliatory Israeli air raids. \n",

       "Anti-Taliban fighters say they have captured key areas in the mountainous Tora Bora region in eastern Afghanistan. The military success comes as the White House considers publicly releasing a videotape which officials say shows Osama bin Laden showing pleasure and surprise at the extent of damage caused by the September 11 attacks. The video was found in a home in Afghanistan 10 days ago. US President George W Bush says when he saw the tape he was reminded of how just the United States' war on terror is. \"Those who see this tape will realise that Osama is guilty of incredible murder,\" he said. \"He has no conscience and no soul ... he represents the worst of civilisation.\" The White House says it will be a couple of days before legal experts decide whether the tape can be released. Meanwhile, reports from London say United States army officers have secretly entered Somalia in the first indication of the extension of the war against terrorism. Five military personnel have held discussions with a rebel Somali group to find the location of suspected terrorist camps. Since the September 11 attacks, the US has taken several steps against Somali individuals and organisations. \n",
       "Israeli helicopters have again attacked Palestinian targets in the Gaza Strip. It is the latest in a series of attacks designed to put pressure on the Palestinian Authority to take tougher action against militants accused of violence against Israelis. Two helicopters returned to the skies above Gaza's north in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Eyewitnesses report seeing them fire as many as four missiles into a security post in the north-eastern township of Bayt Hanum. The small one storey building is a local command station for Yasser Arafat's personal guard, Force-17. The building was completely destroyed, but nobody was injured in the attack. Israel has accused Force-17 of direct involvement in the preparation and execution of attacks against its people. But the Palestinian Authority insists it is a legitimate force and a key part of the Palestinian security infrastructure. \n",

It could be 48 hours before tests can confirm whether the disease has spread further. Two of the woman's three children, a boy aged 13 and a 10-year-old girl, have been quarantined with their mother in the Christmas Island hospital. A third child remains at the island's sports hall, where locals say conditions are crowded and hot. All 540 detainees on Christmas island are being monitored by a health team for signs of fever or abdominal pains, the key symptoms of typhoid, which is spread by contact with contaminated food or water. Hygiene measures have also been stepped up.

       "Qantas has unveiled Australia's latest airline today, launching its single-class \"leisure carrier\", Australian Airlines, which will start operating in the third quarter of next year. Initial flights will be from Cairns to Osaka, Nagoya, Singapore, Taipei, Hong Kong and Fukuoka. The board of Qantas gave the go-ahead for the new airline at a meeting last week. Although wholly owned by Qantas, it will have its own separate management and will operate independently of Qantas. An initial fleet of four Boeing 767-300 aircraft will eventually be increased to 12 and services will be extended to every Australian mainland capital, including Perth and Darwin. Australian Airlines is currently negotiating with various unions on wages, conditions and work practices. Australian Airlines is expected to announce it will base its operations in Cairns, following yesterday's Queensland Cabinet approval of an incentive package for the airline. The new airline plans to cut costs by outsourcing some maintenance work and reducing the number of flight attendants. Chief executive Denis Adams says Australian Airlines will operate at far less cost than Qantas, so that re-opened routes to Asian cities will be profitable. Mr Adams says some maintenance work could be outsourced to Singapore, Taipai or Auckland. He says savings will also be achieved with flexibility in the workplace, including conditions, work rules and rostering. The Queensland Tourism Industry Council's Daniel Gschwind, says the airline will open up new routes from Asia for all international tourists. \"It will give them greater incentive to travel to regional Queensland, travel to the Whitsundays, travel to Brisbane even and further south. \"It will generate enormous traffic through Cairns and it will energise the whole state from an international tourism perspective,\" Mr Gschwind said. \n",

       "The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the overnight crash of a Royal Flying Doctor Service aircraft near Mount Gambier, in South Australia's south-east, which claimed the life of the 54-year-old pilot. The crash has been described as both a double tragedy and a miraculous story of survival. The aircraft was on approach to Mount Gambier Airport when it came down in a block of scrub and young pine trees, about four kilometres short of the runway. It levelled a 200-metre-long path through the vegetation before breaking up and catching fire. The pilot was killed, but the only other person on board, a 34-year-old nurse from nearby Millicent, suffered only minor injuries. Chief Inspector Bronwyn Killmier says she was stunned that the nurse walked away virtually unscathed. The aircraft had been flying from Port Augusta to collect a six-year-old boy and take him to Sydney for a liver transplant. Chief Inspector Killmier says the boy and his mother had been waiting at the airport. \"The donor went to another person, it is a double tragedy, I mean the pilot's family as well as the six-year-old boy's family.\" \n",
       "The Australian cricket team has arrived in Adelaide to prepare for the first Test against South Africa starting on Friday. Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, who is in the squad in place of pace bowler Andy Bichel says he is not perturbed by reports of a clash of personality with fellow spinner Shane Warne. MacGill says they have always got on well in the five Tests where they have both played. \"Cricket teams all over the world are made up of very different people and whilst I'm saying that 'yes, I am different to Shane', I'm also different to Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie and it's the same thing I think you'll find in most local cricket clubs,\" he said. Warne has also played down reports of a rift, saying he and MacGill have no problems, but that he does enjoy the rivalry. South Africa will go into Friday's first Test against Australia in Adelaide with most of its batsmen in good form. The South Africans scored 5 for 390 in their second innings in the match against Western Australia in Perth with centuries from Jacques Kallis and Neil McKenzie, and half centuries from Gary Kirsten and Lance Klusener. \n",
       "Most of the Tora Bora mountain complex in eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda fighters have been hiding, has been captured by Afghan militia forces, military commander Hazrat Ali said. \"We control all of the Melawa and Tora Bora area, except for one place,\" Mr Ali told reporters, adding that Al Qaeda still held the very top of the mountain. \"We have captured all of the Al Qaeda places with heavy weapons,\" he said, speaking through an interpreter. The rout came on the seventh day of a fierce offensive by United States warplanes and Afghan militiamen on the Tora Bora area, which is riddled with caves used by Afghan mujahideen during the 1979-1989 war against the Soviets. Earlier, Mr Ali's spokesman, Amin, told the AFP news agency that anti-Taliban forces had captured a number of strategic heights in the White Mountains range, in which Tora Bora is situated, from Al Qaeda fighters. \"We have taken Melawa, Palanai and a large portion of Anzare Sar,\" Amin said. Four Saudi-born Al Qaeda fighters had been killed he added. Amin said US warplanes had been pounding the area heavily but had in the last few hours stopped the bombing \"due to our advances\". Local commanders are convinced bin Laden, wanted for the September 11 terrorist atrocities in the United States, is holed up in the Tora Bora area with his followers. \n",
       "The Israel Government has expressed regret and promised an investigation into how two children were killed and several others were injured during a botched assassination attempt on a leading Islamic Jihad militant. The children died when helicopter gunships fired on two cars in the West Bank city of Hebron. Israeli forces were attempting to kill Mohammed Sidr, a man they say is responsible for many attacks. He escaped injured, but alive but two boys aged three and 13 died. Israeli Government spokesman Arye Mekel says he deeply regrets the deaths and that many Israeli children have also suffered. \"What happened here is being investigated and hopefully it will never happen again, but we have to understand this is a war,\" Mr Mekel said. Another Palestinian was killed in the West Bank town of Ramallah when his truck exploded shortly before the arrival of US envoy Anthony Zinni who was there to see Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Mr Zinni met with Mr Arafat in a fresh attempt to broker a cease-fire with Israel, a Palestinian official said. The meeting in Ramallah followed talks between Zinni and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, a day after the US envoy threatened to quit if the two sides failed to agree on a truce. \"President Arafat asked Mr Zinni to put pressure on Israel to stop its assassinations, its military escalation and to lift the blockade on Palestinian territories,\" Nabil Abu Rudeina, an advisor to Mr Arafat said. Mr Arafat also pledged that he was determined to cooperate with the US peace envoy in his quest to secure an Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire. On Sunday, Mr Zinni told Palestinian and Israeli security officials they had 48 hours to make \"substantial progress\" or else he would return to Washington, ending a two-week-old peace mission, an Israeli official said. United States Secretary of State Colin Powell said in Berlin that the US and Germany were working \"to get the violence down\" in the Middle East in order to get back to peace talks. Speaking to reporters after meeting with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, Mr Powell said: \"We are trying to get the violence down so the negotiating process can begin\". He said \"we will continue to work as hard as we can to get both sides\", Israel and Palestine, back to the peace process. In Brussels, the European Union challenged Mr Arafat to dismantle the \"terrorist networks\" of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and  to publicly call for an end to the Palestinians' armed intifada. Foreign ministers from the 15 EU member states issued the strongly-worded message after talks in Brussels with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and the Palestinian international cooperation minister Nabil Shaath. \n",

The Pentagon says more than 80 strike aircraft - most of which were FA-18 fighter jets flying from aircraft carriers stationed in the area - have flown sorties over Afghanistan. They were accompanied by long-range B-52 bombers who targeted areas of the White Mountains near Jalalabad where Osama bin Laden is believed to be leading his fighters. In Washington, there is some division about what to do with the man accused of the September 11 attacks. As the BBC reports, dealing with bin Laden and Mullah Mohammad Omar is one of the most difficult problems confronting the United States and senior officials are disagreeing publicly on the issue. Vice-President Dick Cheney says that if either man was captured by other forces they must be handed over to the United States to face justice. The Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has suggested they could be tried elsewhere. Mr Cheney said the leaders were exactly the sort of people who would be tried by the military courts. He gave a strong defence of the court saying extremists had used previous open trials to learn new ways to attack the United States. \n",

Mr Sharon has sent in his warplanes, helicopter gunships and tanks to Palestinian police stations across the territories to pile pressure on Mr Arafat to arrest and sentence Islamic extremists behind a wave of suicide bombings on Israeli cities in the past week. Two Palestinians were killed and more than 120 injured in the air strikes. \n",
       "An International study has found thousands of Australians are involved in the child sex industry, but it remains a largely invisible problem. The report author and national director of Child Wise, Bernadette McMenamin, says the 10-year study revealed a growing number of Australians are involved in paedophilia, child pornography and child sex tours. It also found a growing number of children are working as prostitutes in order to survive. Ms McMenamin says the advent of the Internet has made it easier for offenders to promote sex tours, share images and information, and establish international networks. The child sex trade report has made 29 recommendations to the Federal Government on how to improve investigations of child sex offences and provide improved services to affected children. Ms McMenamin says Australian authorities are ignoring the growing number of children working as prostitutes, preferring to call them homeless or children without support. Ms McMenamin says more needs to be done to address the role of commercial sex in survival on the streets \"We're currently not meeting their needs, they're falling through the gaps, they are not entering services because the services aren't gearing towards the needs that these young people have when they're on the streets and they're really, really vulnerable,\" she said. \n",
       "Qantas management and unions representing the airline's maintenance workers will meet again today after marathon talks last night failed to resolve a wage dispute. Unions are fighting a proposed 12 to 18 month wage freeze and to secure a better career structure for their 2,500 employees. Bill Shorten of the Australian Workers Union (AWU) says the unions will not rest until a satisfactory outcome is reached. \"After eight hours, the AWU and AMWU are still talking to Qantas, we will resume tomorrow morning at 11am [AEDT] in the Industrial Relations Commission to see if we can't work through this position our members now find ourselves in,\" he said last night. Meanwhile, Ansett workers will sing Christmas carols in front of the Prime Minister's Kirribilli residence in Sydney this morning to remind John Howard about their owed entitlements. The Transport Workers Union (TWU) will hold a 24-hour picket outside Kirribilli House and says about 16,000 workers and their families are facing a bleak Christmas. The News South Wales secretary of the TWU, Tony Sheldon, says the Government promised to deliver about $195 million in entitlements. Mr Sheldon says the financial situation for many workers has reached crisis point. \"There's been very little delivered by this Government, a lot of promises, a lot of noise was made before the federal election but very little in substance. \"It's important John Howard delivers for the tourism community, for the Ansett workers and for the Australian community generally,\" Mr Sheldon said. \n",
       "An Iraqi doctor, being held at Sydney's Villawood Detention Centre, claims he was prevented from receiving a human rights award. Dr Aamer Sultan had been awarded a special commendation at yesterday's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission awards in Sydney but was not able to receive the honour in person. Dr Sultan says he had been hoping to attend the ceremony but says the management at Villawood stopped him from going. \"I submitted a formal request to the centre manager who promised me that he will present the matter to migration management here who are the main authority here. \"They also came back that unfortunately we can[not] fulfill this request for you, but they didn't give any explanation.\" Dr Sultan says he was disappointed by the decision. The Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, has written a letter of complaint to the Medical Journal of Australia, about an article penned by Dr Sultan on the psychological state of detainees at Villawood. The journal has published research Dr Sultan conducted with former visiting psychologist to the centre, Kevin O'Sullivan. Their survey of 33 detainees over nine months found all but one displayed symptoms of psychological distress at some time. The article says 85 per cent acknowledged chronic depressive symptoms, and close to half of the group had reached severe stages of depression. \n",

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has found gambling was the biggest money winner for casinos, making up 80 per cent or $2.5 billion of total income. Governments also did well, taking more than $500 million from the casinos for gambling taxes and levies while the 20,000 employees were paid more than $800 million for their work. But despite the expense, the profit for Australian casinos increased by 19 per cent for the year. At the end of June this year, there was almost 11,000 poker and gaming machines and more than 1,000 gaming tables across Australia. \n",

The Howard Government established the commission in July prior to calling the federal election, prompting union claims of a political witch-hunt. But Royal Commissioner Terence Cole QC has stressed the independence of his inquiry. He will examine claims of corruption, coercion and anti-competitive behaviour in the industry. Unions had initially refused to cooperate with the inquiry, but key union figures, including Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) secretary Martin Kingham, have been summonsed to give evidence.

       "The Federal Government has confirmed there is a blowout in the Defence budget because of the cost of sending troops to Afghanistan. Defence Minister Robert Hill says the Government will have to consider delaying some Defence projects because of the cost of sending troops to the war against terrorism, but says no projects will be scrapped. Senator Hill says the cost of the deployment means some projects outlined in last year's Defence white paper will have to be reprioritised. He says the Government's options are to boost defence spending or to delay some projects. \"Now what I'm saying is you can't enter into major undertakings like contributing to the war against terrorism without knowing it's going to cost extra money,\" he said. \"We have to fund that, there are a range of options to do that.\" The Federal Opposition says Senator Hill must reveal which projects would be affected. Shadow Defence Minister Chris Evans says the Government should also come clean on the cost of using the Navy to intercept asylum seekers. \n",
       "The Australian Government is continuing to talk to Indian authorities about a man who has confessed to planning attacks against Australia amongst other countries. Twenty-eight-year-old Mohammed Afroz, who undertook pilot training in Australia in 1997 and 1998, has been charged with waging war against India. He has also made claims about planning terrorist attacks in Australia with the Rialto Towers in Melbourne one target. While the Government is taking the claims seriously, there is some skepticism about them. The Attorney-General Daryl Williams says some of the detail of the claims simply has not been accurate. The claim the man's relatives in Europe have links to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network has been found to be untrue. Australia is asking India for permission to talk to the man, but Government sources say they will not confirm if the request has been granted. \n",
       "A gunman has died after he went on a shooting rampage that left another person dead and several more people wounded at a factory in Goshen, Indiana, officials said. The gunman was found dead at the scene, but \"it's not clear whether the suspect shot himself\", Elkhart County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. Officials said a second person was killed and several more were wounded. The shooter was fired from Nu-Wood Decorative Millwork factory after getting into a fight around lunchtime Thursday local time and threatened to return with a gun, the wife of one employee told WNDU television. Four victims were taken to Goshen General Hospital shortly after the incident began around 3:00pm (7:00am AEDT) hospital spokeswoman Donna Rohrer said. Three of them \"were being evaluated\", for their injuries, a fourth casualty was airlifted to a hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana, she said.

       "New Zealand's ambassador to Brazil, Denise Almao, said she had identified the body of murdered sea hero Sir Peter Blake, but she would not say how he died. According to initial police reports, Mr Blake was shot dead by pirates who bordered his yacht, Seamaster, off the town of Macapa, in the mouth of the Amazon River. He was said to have been shot twice in the back, although his mother said she had been told that he was shot in the head. Joyce Blake also told Radio New Zealand that unidentified people had held a grudge against her son. Ms Almao told the radio station she had gone to Macapa to identify the body. \"He was shot twice,\" she said. She would not say if he was shot in the back. Two other crew members who were injured in the attack had been treated in hospital and had returned to the Seamaster, Ms Almao said. \"They seem okay. The injuries they suffered were not serious.\" New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark says she feels devastated by Mr Blake's death. \"I think he is to the waters what Sir Edmund Hillary has been to the mountains. You couldn't find a more public-spirited man than this,\" she said. Ms Almao said Brazilians were also in shock and were providing every sort of assistance. \"My impression is that there is a very active investigation proceeding, that everyone from the governor on down is offering every assistance and I think they are doing their utmost to bring the perpetrators to justice,\" she said. \n",
       "A Swiss fireman has told a court how he snapped a photograph of a body being swept along by a two-metre high wave as a flash flood rushed down a river gorge. Markus Gerber said he took the photo to prove that his eyes were not deceiving him as he saw the wave sweep down the Saxet canyon following a thunderstorm on July 27, 1999. \"I needed proof that I was not deceived that there was a human being in the wave,\" Mr Gerber said. \"I couldn't tell if there was anyone else in the wave, I was expecting that this was a single case.\" But Mr Gerber's optimism was wrong. The flash flood had swamped a group of tourists on a canyoning excursion, killing 18 tourists, 14 of them Australians, and three guides. Eight staff of the now-defunct Adventure World company are charged with manslaughter through culpable negligence for allowing the tour to go ahead despite the risk of flood from the storm. Mr Gerber became angry as he told the court he had tried to convince Adventure World vice-president Peter Balmer of the need for closer cooperation between his company and the emergency services. \"For one-and-a-half or two years I called Mr Balmer and tried to convince him to see that Saxetbach was dangerous, but Mr Balmer assured me that they were all right, there were no problems there,\" Mr Gerber said. \"I finally called him again and said the fire brigade would not take responsibility if anything happened.\" Asked if he rang Adventure World on the day of the accident to warn them about the storm forecast, he said: \"No\". \n",
       "The United States offered full and direct approval to Indonesia's 1975 invasion of East Timor, a move by then-president Suharto which consigned the territory to 25 years of oppression, official documents released today showed. The documents prove conclusively for the first time that the United States gave a 'green light' to the invasion, the opening salvo in an occupation that cost the lives of up to 200,000 East Timorese. General Suharto briefed US president Gerald Ford and his secretary of state Henry Kissinger on his plans for the former Portuguese colony hours before the invasion, according to documents collected by George Washington University's National Security Archive. When Mr Ford and Mr Kissinger called in to Jakarta on their way back from a summit in Beijing on December 6 1975, Suharto claimed that in the interests of Asia and regional stability, he had to bring stability to East Timor to which Portugal was trying to grant autonomy. \"We want your understanding if we deem it necessary to take rapid or drastic action,\" Suharto told his visitors, according to a long-classified State Department cable. Mr Ford replied: \"We will understand and will not press you on the issue. We understand the problem you have and the intentions you have.\" Mr Kissinger, who has denied the subject of Timor came up during the talks,  appeared to be concerned about the domestic political implications of an Indonesian invasion. \"It is important that whatever you do succeeds quickly, we would be able to influence the reaction in America if whatever happens happens after we return. \"The president will be back on Monday at 2pm Jakarta time. We understand your problem and the need to move quickly, but I am only saying that it would be better if it were done after we returned.\" The invasion took place on December 7, the day after the Ford-Suharto meeting. Mr Kissinger has consistently rejected criticism of the Ford administration's conduct on East Timor. During a launch in 1995 for his book <i>Diplomacy</i> Mr Kissinger said at a New York hotel it was perhaps \"regrettable\" that for US officials, the implications of Indonesia's Timor policy were lost in a blizzard of geo-political issues following the Vietnam War. \n",

If convicted 28-year-old Mohammed Afroz faces hanging or life imprisonment. Police say Afroz was arrested on October 2 after he was found staying in a hotel close to his home. They say Afroz had claimed Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network was planning terrorist attacks in Australia, Britain and India similar to the September 11 attacks on the United States. Razzak reportedly told police four al-Qaeda suicide squads in total had been tasked to carry out hits on the World Trade Centre in New York, the British parliament, a tower block in Australia and India's parliament in New Delhi. Police say an email sent by Afroz to an address in Australia had mentioned plans to attack Britain's House of Commons after hijacking a plane. The Press Trust of India says Razzak spent $212,000 on flying lessons in Australia, Britain and the United States. The Hindustan Times newspaper has also quoted unidentified officials as saying Afroz admitted during questioning the Al Qaeda network had sent him to flight training schools in Australia, Britain and India.

       "The armed wing of the radical Islamic movement, Hamas has threatened to attack officials from the ruling Palestinian Authority if the Hamas spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, or any of its militants are harmed. It follows the death in Gaza City last night of a Hamas supporter during clashes that erupted when Palestinian police put Sheikh Ahmed Yassin under house arrest. Those clashes have created an unstable situation in Gaza. It was Palestinian against Palestinian as hundreds of police confronted 3,000 Hamas supporters, who determined their leader would not be arrested as part of the crackdown on militants. Stone-throwing youths were met with baton charges, but still the Palestinian police do not have control around the Sheikh's house. The action came against the backdrop of frantic diplomatic activity aimed at averting all-out conflict. The Egyptian Foreign Minister made an emergency visit to both Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, urging negotiation rather than confrontation. Palestinian Authorities say they have detained 160 suspects but so far, the Israeli Government says Mr Arafat has not done enough. A security meeting has been arranged between the Israelis and the Palestinians to try to defuse the growing crisis between them. Mr Arafat says the meeting has been set up by the US special envoy to the Middle East, Anthony Zinni.

He predicts the United States economy will show signs of recovery from mid-year, and that as a result it is highly unlikely that the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates in the next six months. \"Calendar year 2001 has been a difficult one for the world economy and the first half of 2002 looks like remaining weak before recovery gets underway. \"Therefore this period will be classified as a world recession like those of the mid 70s, the early 80s and the early 90s,\" Mr Macfarlane said. \"The Australian economy has got through the first half of it in reasonably good shape.\" \n",

AFP reported the sponsors, PR company Jour J, as saying he was killed while leading a sailing expedition up the Amazon river, in the western Amazon Basin.

A meticulous planner and a gifted leader, Mr Blake's fierce determination to win always inspired immense loyalty from his crews and unlimited confidence from his backers. The New Zealander was the only man to compete in the first five Whitbreads and his 1989 victory in Steinlager 2 came with an unprecedented clean sweep as his team walked off with line, handicap and overall honours on each of the race's six legs.

Both Simon Wiget and Stefan Abegglen told the court of their sorrow about the accident, but denied making any mistakes, nor did they think weather conditions were inappropriate. Asked if they had received adequate training in weather analysis from their Adventure World supervisors, they said they had.

       "Three US troops and five members of the Afghan opposition were killed by a stray US bomb near Kandahar in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. The Pentagon had earlier confirmed that two US special forces soldiers were killed and 20 others wounded north of Kandahar when a B-52 bomber dropped a 2,000-pound bomb too close to them. \"The B-52 was flying in support of opposition forces north of Kandahar,\" said Pentagon spokeswoman Victori Clark. \"We have an update since this morning, and unfortunately the number of US forces killed is now three.\" Rival Afghan factions signed an historic power-sharing agreement to form a post-Taliban government and set the country on the road to recovery and democracy after two decades of war. The accord was sealed after nine days of exhausting negotiations and paves the way for a six-month interim administration headed by moderate Muslim Hamid Karzai, from the dominant Pashtun ethnic group. The deal gives the Northern Alliance control of three key portfolios in the 30-member cabinet, which includes two women and is due to be up and running by December 22. It also gives a symbolic role to the former king and provides for a UN security force for Kabul. The agreement was signed in the German city of Bonn by the leaders of the four delegations and UN special envoy for Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi to applause from an audience which included German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. \"We were the champions of resistance and will be proud to be the champions of peace,\" said Yunus Qanooni, the Northern Alliance's chief negotiator and the  interim government's interior minister. A delegate from the so-called Peshawar group, Sayed Hamed Gailani, summed up the atmosphere in a single phrase. \"There are two things evident today: Yesterday's rain does not have the courage to cry, and the sun cannot hide its smile,\" he said. The appointment of Karzai, a 44-year-old tribal Pashtun tribal leader currently fighting the Taliban near their last stronghold of Kandahar, was seen as an attempt to balance Afghanistan's delicate ethnic mix. It cements a whirlwind transformation in Afghanistan's fate since the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the trigger for massive US air  strikes that have dislodged the Taliban militia from most of the country and put the Northern Alliance back on top. Showing the strain from nine days of frantic diplomacy, Brahimi recognised the accord was far from perfect, and that its signatories were not fully representative of the Afghan people \n",
       "The Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, has expressed concern about a man who was arrested in India and has reportedly confessed to planning suicide attacks in Australia. The man was arrested a month ago in India on suspicion of links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. India's Home Minister, LK Advani, has been quoted by the Reuters news agency as telling a meeting of business and industry leaders in New Delhi that the man has confessed to planning suicide attacks in Australia and Britain, as well as on the Indian Parliament. The report says Mr Advani says Indian authorities have confirmed and verified the confessions. Mr Downer has told Channel Seven it should not be dismissed. \"I understand that his claim, that he wanted to conduct suicide attacks against a number of countries including Australia, is a claim that he believes,\" Mr Downer said. \"I don't think this is a hoax or should be treated as a hoax. \"I think these are claims that need to be taken seriously  - we can be grateful for the fact that he has been arrested by Indian authorities.\" \n",
       "Israel has demanded the arrest of 36 Palestinian militants and given leader Yasser Arafat just 12 hours to comply. The Government says if those on the list are not rounded up in time, the army will resume its attacks on Palestinian targets. Mr  Arafat was told of the deadline by the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, in a telephone conversation. The Palestinian leader said his security forces could not move to make the arrests because of fear of Israeli bombing. So now, he has just 12 hours in which his men will be given free rein. Mr Arafat has accused the Israelis of attempting to sabotage attempts to jail militants and undermine his authority. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman earlier said Mr Arafat was finished and it was time for a new Palestinian leader. \n",
       "Two Swiss guides who survived the 1999 Interlaken canyoning accident - in which 14 Australians died - have denied any wrongdoing in leading the trip into the Saxet River. A court in Switzerland has been told the huge wall of water which swept down the river was an unpredictable natural catastrophe. Both Simon Wiget and Stefan Abegglen told the court of their sorrow about the accident, but denied making any mistakes, nor did they think weather conditions were inappropriate. Asked if they had received adequate training in weather analysis from their Adventure World supervisors, they said they had. But when asked what specific training they received, they were unable to give detail. They also acknowledged their salaries as guides were dependent on the number of trips they took and the number of people who accompanied them. For some of the Australians the day ended with an emotional visit to the river where their children died. \n",
       "High interest rates on credit cards have prompted a call for an inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The Australian Consumers Association (ACA) says banks are not passing on all Reserve Bank interest rate cuts. The association's Katherine Wolthuizen says while the Reserve Bank again cut official interest rates yesterday, credit card interest rates remain high. \"We would certainly like to see a proper investigation into that and hopefully some movement to bring the banks to account for it. \"They don't like being regulated and sometimes the threat of regulation can cause them to amend their ways, but of course they do have a very long way to go,\" Ms Wolthuizen said. \n",

       "The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has moved to clarify what it says are misunderstandings about a report on the Indian economy, launched by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. The 172-page document released on Monday says Australian firms could become more competitive by outsourcing to India's information technology (IT) sector. The Community and Public Sector Union has been critical of the report, saying DFAT is encouraging Australian businesses to export jobs to India. But the department says the aim is to boost Australia's export potential and encourage competitiveness in the industry. DFAT does not want to make any further comment and the Minister's office says he is not available for interview. \n",
       "Counting is proceeding very slowly in the Solomon Islands national elections, as  officials are keen to avoid any allegations of vote tampering. There was a heavy police presence around the three counting centres in the Solomon Islands capital, Honiara, when the first ballot boxes were opened late last night. Counting in some of the more remote of the 50 seats in the Solomon Islands Parliament will not even start until Saturday after the ballot boxes are transferred to a single location. A large contingent of international observers are monitoring the count in an election that is regarded as crucial if the Solomons is to break out of a cycle of economic and social disintegration, flowing from a bitter ethnic war between armed militants from its two largest provinces. \n",
       "Australian swimmers have won nine of the 12 events contested at the skins swimming event in Sydney last night. The 50 metres races were swum in an elimination format with four races to determine the overall winner. Geoff Huegill won the 50 metres butterfly in 24.21 seconds and is looking forward to the World Cup event in Melbourne tomorrow. \"Every race is just getting better and better in terms of jumping in and making sure that I nail the first 15 [metres] under water and exploding out of the water and really working turns and trying to nail finishes,\" he said. Elka Graham won the women's 300 metres freestyle which was contested by having three races over 100 metres. She says former champion Kieren Perkins was behind her victory. \"I swam with Kieren this morning and he gave me some awesome advice. He told me to close my eyes [in the last 25 metres] and to absolutely go for it,\" she said. American Ed Moses won the men's 50 metres breaststroke while Liesel Jones took the women's event. World champion Matt Welsh was the first swimmer eliminated from the 50 metres backstroke,  which was eventually won by Australia's Ray Hass. The winners of each event received five thousand dollars but Welsh had an early night when he was the first eliminated in the  50 metres event won by Ray Hass. Rebecca Creedy caused another upset, defeating Sarah Ryan in the 50 metres freestyle. Julia Ham won the women's 50 metres butterfly and says the $5,000 in prize money will go towards paying for a $13,000 heater for the pool in Queensland where she trains children. \"The thermostat's broken on the old one, it just goes up and down and I went in yesterday and it was 36 degrees in the water and it was just terrible.

Three people have been injured after an apparent Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up outside the Hilton Hotel in west Jerusalem. Israeli police say the three were standing at a bus stop and were hurt by flying glass when the explosion occurred near an entrance to the former Hilton Hotel. The suicide bombing follows a wave of Israeli air strikes against Palestinian security installations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after 25 people were killed at the weekend in several suicide bombings. \n",
       "Four Afghan factions have reached agreement on an interim cabinet during talks in Germany. The United Nations says the administration, which will take over from December 22 will be headed by the royalist anti-Taliban commander Hamed Karzai. It concludes more than a week of negotiations outside Bonn and is aimed at restoring peace and stability to the war ravaged country. The 44-year-old former deputy foreign minister, who is currently battling the Taliban around the southern city of Kandahar, is an ally of the exiled Afghan king Mohammed Zahir Shah. He will serve as chairman of an interim authority that will govern Afghanistan for a six-month period, before a Loya Jirga or grand traditional assembly of elders, in turn appoints an 18-month transitional government. Meanwhile, United States Marines are now reported to have been deployed in eastern Afghanistan where opposition forces are closing in on al-Qaeda soldiers. Reports from the area say there has been a gun battle between the opposition and al-Qaeda close to the Tora Bora cave complex where Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding. In the south of the country, American marines are taking part in patrols around the air base they have secured near Kandahar, but are unlikely to take part in any assault on the city. However, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard Myers says they are prepared for anything. \"They are prepared for engagements, they're a robust fighting force and they're absolutely ready to engage if that's required,\" he said. \n",
       "The Reserve Bank has cut official interest rates again, still concerned about the slowing global economy. The central bank has delivered a further cut of 0.25 of a per cent. It is the sixth rate cut for the year, taking the cash rate to 4.25 per cent. The cut has been quickly passed on in full by all the major banks and a host of smaller lenders. The Reserve Bank says international conditions remain weak, with the US and Japanese economies in recession, Europe stalled and contractions in a number of Australia's east Asian trading partners. The bank says 2001 and 2002 combined will produce the weakest period of growth since the early 1980s, although the threat of an even sharper decline after the September 11 attacks in the US has abated somewhat. Low interest rates and a sharp drop in oil prices should see a recovery start in the 12 months ahead. Westpac's Bill Evans is among those who believe the cut will not be the last. \"The Reserve Bank has certainly not closed the door to further rate cuts next year,\" he said. \n",
       "Federal Treasurer Peter Costello has warned continued economic growth in Australia is dependent on an uncertain world outlook. The latest figures show the economy grew by 1.1 per cent in the September quarter. Mr Costello is stressing the seriousness of the current global economic downturn. \"As serious as anything we've seen in the last two decades,\" he said. Both he and the Reserve Bank governor, Ian MacFarlane believe the timing of any pickup is unclear. Mr Costello is hopeful about the United States prospects next year and says a pickup sooner rather than later in the year could keep Australia in a strong position. \"I think with every confidence, the December quarter is going to be strong, if the US comes back we might defy again what has happened in the world,\" he said. Shadow Treasurer Bob McMullan says the Treasurer is left relying on things out of his control. \"All the Treasurer has got in plan for 2002 is the hope the American economy will pick up in time,\" he said. He says the Government has limited its own ability to respond to the international shocks by spending too much this year. \n",

Swans chief executive Kelvin Templeton says the club would welcome Lockett back. \"We're not putting any undue pressure on him,\" Mr Templeton said. \"The approach really came from Tony to us, rather than the other way.\" Mr Templeton says if Lockett does make a comeback, the club would not expect him to play every game. \"He certainly could play a role, albeit a reduced role from the one the fans knew him to hold a couple of years back,\" he said. \n",
       "The Royal Commission into HIH has been adjourned until Monday after interviewing of the first witness ended abruptly. Lawyers acting on behalf of several former HIH directors requested that cross-examination of David Lombe and an inspector appointed by insurance watchdog, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) be held at a later date. The commission was due to hear evidence from Mr Lombe after the details of his report for APRA were read in this morning's hearing. The report raises allegations that corporate governance was inadequate and concealed the true state of HIH's financial position. The report questions the solvency of HIH prior to it being placed into provisional liquidation on March 15. It raises issues of intangible assets like tax and goodwill, being treated as tangible for the acquisition of Allianz to boost the financial position of HIH. The report also says significant losses by HIH in the United States and the United Kingdom were concealed from APRA at meetings last year. The commission has also heard APRA had serious concerns about the accounting practices being followed by HIH in July last year. \n",

It is the first claim to be settled in the Darwin region. The agreement was due to be signed off before the last Northern Territory election, but was delayed by the death of an elder's son. The Larrakia people plan to take a lease from the Territory Government under commercial terms and develop almost 50 hectares in the new Palmerston suburb of Rosebury over the next few years.

He says for security reasons specific tasks, locations and missions will not be revealed. Meanwhile, a senior member of the Northern Alliance attending the UN-sponsored Afghan talks in Bonn said that an interim Afghan administration would assume power on December 22. Ahmad Wali Masood, brother of the assassinated legendary Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Masood, also said he expected the four Afghan groups locked in intensive dialogue for eight days would reach agreement on composition of the government later on Tuesday. \"I expect a result tonight,\" Wali Masood said, adding that all four Afghan groups negotiating in Bonn had submitted their lists of nominees to the United Nations. Earlier on Tuesday, diplomatic sources indicated that new interim government for Afghanistan was expected to be installed in Kabul next week. \"The interim government will be installed one week after the signature (of the Bonn accord) and thereupon enjoy international recognition,\" said a western  diplomat among official observers at the conference. \"This will mean that (ousted president Burhanuddin) Rabbani is no longer recognised,\" the source said.

       "Israel launched massive air raids across the West Bank and Gaza Tuesday, piling pressure on Yasser Arafat with a rocket strike on  a police post next to his offices, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon branded his administration a \"sponsor of terrorism\". Israeli F-16 warplanes launched a series of strikes on Gaza City, while Apache helicopters fired rockets on Palestinian security offices in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip and on the West Bank towns of Salfit and Tulkarem. They also fired missiles on a security post just metres from Mr Arafat's offices in Ramallah, but the Palestinian leader, who was in his office at the time, was unhurt. But two policemen were slightly wounded, officials said. Israeli army spokesman Brigadier General Ron Kitrey said Mr Arafat was not targeted. Two people were killed in the Gaza strikes and around 120 injured, half of them schoolboys, Palestinian hospital officials said. The attacks came as Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he did not believe Israeli forces would take direct action against the Palestinian  leader. The strikes also came a day after Mr Sharon, furious that Mr Arafat had not stopped hardline Islamic groups, who killed two dozen Israelis in devastating suicide attacks at the weekend, ordered his forces to blast symbols of Mr Arafat's  power. Gunships destroyed Mr Arafat's three helicopters in Gaza City, while bulldozers ploughed up the runway at Gaza international airport used by Mr Arafat for his frequent travels abroad. Palestinian officials called Mr Sharon's campaign an attempt to topple Mr Arafat and destroy his self-rule Palestinian Authority. Mr Arafat told CNN television that Mr Sharon was trying to torpedo his own crackdown on terrorism with the airstrikes. \"He doesn't want me to succeed, and for this he is escalating his military activities against our towns, our cities, our establishments,\" the Palestinian leader said. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine accused Israel of conducting a deliberate policy aimed at eliminating Mr Arafat. \"Arafat has been weakened by the harassment of the Israeli army ... and as a result people are using his weakness as an argument to say that since he can not re-establish order in his own camp, he should in some way be eliminated.\" However, Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush expressed \"sympathy\" with Israel and called on all sides \"to do anything they can to stabilise the situation\". Mr Sharon's hard words and air strikes opened major divisions in his cross-party government, with left-wing Mr Peres denouncing what he called a bid during Monday's emergency cabinet meeting to cause \"the downfall of the Palestinian Authority\". The region had been braced for a huge Israeli retaliation after three Palestinian suicide bombers from the hardline Islamic movement Hamas killed 25 people on Saturday and Sunday in the suicide attacks in Jerusalem and Haifa. Mr Sharon made a national address after blasting Gaza City and Jenin in the West Bank on Monday, accusing Mr Arafat of having \"chosen the path of terrorism\" and  being \"the greatest obstacle to peace and stability in the Middle East\". Mr Peres said the move by Mr Sharon's dominant right-wingers \"in effect means Israeli policy is based purely on force with no political hope\". Public radio said Mr Peres had called all the ministers from his Labour Party for a special meeting Wednesday to discuss the fallout of the strikes and Mr Sharon's accusation that Mr Arafat was \"responsible for everything that has happened here\". Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, speaking after Mr Sharon's speech Monday evening, said the words amounted to a \"declaration of war\". He called on the United States and Europe to rein in Mr Sharon and dispatch international observers to oversee the spiralling conflict. \n",
       "Interest rates and economic growth take centre stage for Australian financial markets today. A rates cut is still expected despite what is thought to be a respectable set of national accounts. The Australian economy has been held up as one of the few to be still ticking over well, while so many others around  the world are in recession or slowing sharply. Today's national accounts for the September quarter will be the definitive measure. SG Australia chief economist Glenn Maguire says he expects a quarterly figure of just under 1 per cent. \"If we do see economic growth up around 0.9 per cent, which is the market consensus, that is actually a relatively very good outcome,\" he said. That would translate to an annual growth rate of 2 per cent. Mr Maguire says domestic economic activity remains centred on the housing sector. \"I think the national accounts will reveal that the bulk of economic growth is being driven by the housing sector and those areas which are related to the housing sector, such as retail trade and manufacturing.\" But he says some areas of weakness are emerging. \"Company profits were quite soft. \"Also average earnings are likely to post a softer footing over the quarter as well, so looking forward, softer incomes, probably softer production as well suggest that the domestic economy will be slowing as we move into 2002,\" Mr Maguire said. Financial markets are also waiting on a possible announcement from the Reserve Bank after its board meeting of yesterday. There is a high level of expectation that rates will be cut by 0.25 per cent. The Australian Trade Commission says there are signs of recovery on global markets three months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Senior Austrade staff from across the globe are in Adelaide to discuss the impact of the attack on the US and  major international markets. Austrade's executive general manager Roger Bayliss says the vast majority of global equity markets have bounced back and growth is expected to return by the third quarter of next year. Mr Bayliss says while there are serious challenges ahead, Australian firms should not retreat. \"The most important point is to really study your markets. \"Get good advice, make sure you're looking after your customers well, and certainly not staying in your shell, or in your cocoon, and adopting a very aggressive approach to overseas marketing,\" Mr Bayliss said. \n",
       "The Labor Party is set to have a wide-ranging review of its structures, with frontbencher Martin Ferguson pushing for the process. The new Labor leader, Simon Crean, is taking a set of proposals to next Thursday's national executive meeting. Mr Ferguson wants the meeting to call a review. He says suggestions for party changes, such as the call by frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon for the scrapping of a New South Wales rule forcing Labor members to belong to a union, should be dealt with internally. \"Perhaps the time has come for us to actually sign up to a federal executive process which actually enables debate to go forward in a highly constructive way rather than individual proposals being put out there without an end game in sight,\" Mr Ferguson said. He says he is happy for the process to include looking at abandoning the 60-40 rule, but says scrapping the rule would only be a minor factor in the party's self-examination. \"For a long time I've believed there is a requirement for the Labor Party to actually have a hard look at whether or not an archaic formula of union representation is the key to our future.\" \n",

According to McAfee.com, a leading anti-computer virus software company, the virus is attacking both home and business computers. The company has given the virus a high-risk rating, its most serious warning. The virus, also known as a worm, gets into computers via Microsoft's Outlook email program. If a user activates the virus by opening up an infected email attachment, it can create havoc. The virus, the company warned, \"can delete files from users' computers. The Goner worm then emails itself to every email address contained in the user's address book\". This new virus comes right after the Badtrans Internet worm, another Outlook attacker that replicates itself by sending copies out to everyone on a user's address list. Badtrans, however, did not erase data. McAfee is recommending that users upgrade their anti-virus software. The company also warns against opening up unexpected attachments. \n",
       "Defendants in the Interlaken canyoning trial in Switzerland are continuing to deny they played any role in the deaths of 21 people, including 14-Australians, who drowned in 1999. When chief guide Bernard Strureewas asked why he did not call off the canyoning trip on that fateful July afternoon, he said the water level was so low there would be enough time to evacuate the river if it flooded. Mr Struree told the court guides were instructed to leave the canyon if water levels rose or changed colour, adding they were always advised to pull out if a strong storm was forecast. But like those before him, when asked if he remembered what the weather conditions were like at 4:00pm that afternoon, he said he had not noticed.

The warning, from Fair Trading Minister John Aquilina, follows reports from the suburb of Hornsby that people claiming to work for the SES are asking for payment from the storm victims. Mr Aquilina has reminded householders that the SES is a volunteer organisation and does not charge for its work or employ sub-contractors. He has suggested residents contact the police if they are approached by such people. The Government is also warning householders against dealing with unlicensed tradespeople. \n",

The head of the Australian Council for Educational Research, Professor Geoff Masters, says although the overall Australian results are very encouraging, there are some alarming signs. \"Boys tend to have more negative attitudes to reading, they read less often than girls, they are less interested in reading narrative texts, storybooks for example,\" he said. \n",
       "Hundreds of fans stood vigil today for the immersion of George Harrison's ashes into the Ganges river at the Hindu holy city of Benares. But officials and sect leaders remained tightlipped on when or where last rites for the former Beatle, a long-time devotee of the Hindu Hare Krishna sect, would take place. He was closely attached to Benares, where devout Hindus come to scatter the ashes of their dead relatives in the Ganges in a ritual symbolising the journey of the soul towards eternal salvation. The Beatles' former lead guitarist died on Thursday of cancer, aged 58, amid chants and prayers of Hare Krishna devotees who were at his bedside. According to details of the ceremony released by members of the Hare Krishna movement yesterday, Harrison's widow Olivia accompanied by son Dhani were to scatter some of the ashes early this morning in a \"discreet\" ceremony at Hinduism's holy river. Some of Harrison's ashes could also be immersed in the Ganges at Allahabad - another holy spot for devout Hindus - about 130 kilometres upstream from Benares, a spokesman for the Hare Krishna group said. Tomorrow Harrison's family members were supposed to take part in a special prayer meeting in Vrindavan, the birthplace of Lord Krishna, 150 km north of the Indian capital. The news brought hundreds of journalists, fans and curious onlookers to Benares' 80-odd \"ghats\" - platforms or steps from which the ashes are strewn into the river - this morning. But as the day wore on, local administration officials and Hare Krishna devotees in Benares refused to confirm when and where along the Ganges the ceremony would take place. \n",

       "Israeli forces have launched attacks on some of the key Palestinian symbols of autonomy, including Gaza International Airport. The strikes come as Israeli authorities announced they were stepping up military operations against Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian leadership, meanwhile, appealed for intervention from the United Nations Security Council after Israeli air strikes yesterday and accused Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of declaring war on the Palestinians. Mr Sharon's Government also placed Force-17, the armed group in charge of Mr Arafat's protection, and the Tanzim military groups of his Fatah faction on its list of terrorist organisations, a senior Israeli official said. The decisions were taken in a five-hour marathon late-night session of the national unity government, said the official, who asked not to be named. In a series of incursions and air strikes, the Israeli military targeted Mr Arafat's symbols of power, after holding him to account for a spate of deadly suicide bombings by Palestinian Islamic militants. The Israeli army carried out reprisal attacks against targets in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Israeli tanks advanced to about 500 metres from Mr Arafat's offices in the West Bank town of Ramallah, witnesses and Palestinian security officials said. In the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces penetrated the airport Mr Arafat uses for his travels abroad and started to churn up the only runway, a Palestinian liaison official said. Mr Sharon, blaming Mr Arafat for the weekend suicide bombings that killed 25 Israelis, earlier sent his airforce to blast the Palestinian leader's heliport in Gaza and offices in the West Bank town of Jenin. The radical Islamic movement, Hamas, claimed responsibility for the suicide attacks. Shortly after Apache combat helicopters struck Gaza City and F-16 fighter bombers hit Jenin, Sharon made a hard-hitting televised address, telling Israelis a \"war of terrorism\" had been foisted on the Jewish state. \"In choosing to try to win political accomplishments through murder and in choosing to allow the ruthless killing of civilians, Arafat has chosen the path of terrorism,\" Mr Sharon said. \"Arafat is the greatest obstacle to peace and stability in the Middle East,\" Mr Sharon charged. \n",

Friedli said he was aware of the possibility the river could flood, but when asked whether his company carried out risk analysis he replied: \"We know the region, we live here\". To the question, \"you know what you are accused of, have you made any mistakes?\", Mr Friedli replied: \"No, I don't think so\". \n",
       "Widespread damage from yesterday's violent storms in New South Wales has forced the Government to declare more areas of the State natural disaster zones. Up to 700 volunteers and fire fighters are continuing the big mop-up. State Emergency Services (SES) volunteers are still clearing some of thehuge trees that came crashing down on homes in Sydney's north. Martin Walker was sitting on his back deck when the storm struck \"It sounded like a freight train was about to hit our house. \"You could hear it coming with such ferocity and as it hit, all the trees just seemed to bend and there was stuff hitting the back of our house,\" Mr Walker said. Pitwater, Bankstown, Sutherland, Hurstville and Liverpool in Sydney, and Gunnedah and Tamworth, in the state's north-west, have been added to the list of natural disaster areas. New South Wales Premier Bob Carr has inspected one of the worst hit parts, Wahroonga in Sydney's north. \"I'm struck by the unpredictability of this storm damage, we've had storms before but never winds of this force and it was uneven and unpredictable in its impact,\" Mr Carr said. The final damage bill is expected to be more than $10 million. \n",
       "The Federal Government is under fire from unions over a new departmental report which recommends Australia outsource information technology (IT) to India. The document says India has a low cost skilled workforce. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Alexander Downer, has given his support to the document from his department entitled \"India: New Economy, Old Economy\". The report says sectors like IT, finance and telecommunications offer attractive direct investment opportunities. It also says Australian firms could become more competitive by outsourcing to the Indian IT sector. The Community and Public Sector Union's Wendy Caird says the Government seems to be encouraging local companies to export jobs to India. \"I think that's quite alarming, obviously labour is a great deal cheaper in India and that's assisted by the Indian Government removing labour laws and bankruptcy laws,\" Ms Caird said. The union says while the initiative may create jobs in India, it will not help Australia's rising unemployment. \n",

Lee has not been suspended for any games which will allow him to play in the first Test against South Africa in 10 days. The penalty represents 75 per cent of Lee's match pay for the five-day Test.

       "Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has opened an emergency security Cabinet meeting after placing blame for recent suicide attacks squarely on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. \"I called an urgent meeting of the heads of all the security systems and very shortly the Government will hold a special session, the Government will meet in order to make decisions about how to deal further with terrorism,\" he said in a national address on public television. The Government was to discuss its policy on the Palestinian Authority, which Mr Sharon implied was the enemy of the Jewish state and should bear the consequences. \"Those who rise up against us to kill us are responsible for their own destruction,\" he said, in a statement interpreted by a Palestinian official as a call for war. \"Arafat has made his strategic choices, a strategy of terrorism: in choosing to try to win political accomplishments through murder and in choosing  to allow the ruthless killing of civilians, Arafat has chosen the path of terrorism,\" Mr Sharon said. \"The Government represents practically the whole of the Israel public and we have the paramount goal and need for unity in order to cope with all the brutalities facing us,\" he added. \"Tonight we heard a declaration of war,\" said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat on CNN television. \"Sharon has chosen the path of darkness.\" Even before his address, Israeli helicopters and warplanes attacked targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including Arafat's offices and a police headquarters in Jenin and the Palestinian leader's three helicopters in Gaza City. The air strikes were launched on Palestinian targets in the wake of weekend suicide attacks by the Islamic militant group Hamas which left 26 Israelis dead. Meanwhile, Hamas has defied the Palestinian state of emergency and called for more suicide attacks against Israel at the funeral of a gunman who killed a settler. More than 1,000 supporters of the hardline group gathered to bury 19-year-old Muslim al-Aarage, one of two Palestinians who shot the settler dead on Sunday in the north of the Gaza Strip before being killed by Israeli soldiers. \"The suicide operations will continue as long as the enemy continues its occupation\" of Palestinian lands in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, a militant from the group told a crowd with a loudspeaker. \"When Sharon kills women and children our people have the right to defend ourselves. Then they call us terrorists,\" he said. \"Every religion and law in the world gives us the right to defend ourselves,\" he said, shortly before the air strikes began. Security services have arrested some 100 militants from Hamas and its smaller rival Islamic Jihad in the crackdown since Sunday. Human rights group Amnesty International has condemned \"deliberate attacks\" by the Palestinian suicide bombers at the weekend. \"These attacks are horrifying and tragic,\" Amnesty said in a statement. \"We call on armed groups to end immediately the direct targeting of civilians which  contravenes the most fundamental principles of humanity.\" The organisation called on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority to remember \"that no abuses of human rights by armed groups can excuse violations of fundamental human rights and humanitarian law\". \n",
       "Opposition forces claimed to have captured half of Kandahar airport after fierce fighting with Taliban troops as residents reported a further cranking up of US bombardments on the city. \"We have now taken half of the airport,\" said Gul Lali, a key lieutenant to former Kandahar governor Gul Agha. Lali said that their forces had killed 11 foreign Taliban fighters in the operation and overrun a building that appeared to have been used as an office by members of suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. \"These were 11 of bin Laden's men, from Egypt, Libya and Saudi Arabia. Nineteen more were injured,\" Lali said from the battleground. Opposition commanders had earlier expressed confidence that the airport would fall by the end of the day, with the Taliban's defence tactics hamstrung by aerial attacks from US warplanes. \"We can hope but I am not 100 per cent sure we will capture it by the end of the evening,\" a spokesman for Gul Agha said after speaking to the opposition leader at noon local time. Bombing raids by US warplanes on Taliban positions around the airport had helped the push, according to fighters on the ground. Residents who left Kandahar early Monday confirmed that there had been no let-up in the US bombing. Abdul Masood, 30, said at that planes were now flying in five-strong sorties. \"The frequency has increased. They now come within an interval of half an hour,\" he said. \"They are targeting the airport area and Taliban positions outside the city. \"They are also hitting the road between the city and the airport. I saw at least four trucks which had been overturned, lying on the road.\" Masood also said he had reports that some opposition soldiers had been killed in a suicide attack by Taliban supporters. \"Some people told me that several Arabs with grenades strapped around their abdomen managed to enter an advancing column at Torkotal (near Kandahar airport). I believe there were heavy casualties.\" His claims could not be independently verified but a doctor working for the relief agency Muslim Hands said that he had treated six of Agha's men after they crossed the border Monday. They were later dispatched to Chaman hospital. Nearly 100 civilians have been killed and 200 wounded in three nights of US airstrikes near Jalalabad, the provincial military chief said. Commander Haji Mohammad Zaman said the bombs targeted an area south of Jalalabad near the Tora Bora mountain cave complex where terror suspect Osama bin Laden is believed to have a hideout. Zaman, who directs military operations in Nangarhar province, said the first night of bombings left nearly 80 civilians dead and 150 wounded. A second night of air raids killed eight civilians and wounded 18, he said, and the third night left eight dead and many people injured. \n",

       "Businessmen Solomon Lew and Lindsay Fox have called on the Federal Government to help break Qantas' dominance to ensure their bid for Ansett is successful. The pair met with the Victorian Premier, Steve Bracks, yesterday to update him on the progress of the bid. Over the weekend, the Federal Government ruled out further assistance for the proposal. Mr Lew says he has not requested financial assistance from the Government, but a review of trade practices could be important. He says he is also hopeful the Government will help break Qantas' dominance of the aviation industry. \"We are concerned of the fact that at this point in time...the largest competitor has over 90 per cent market share and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, did quote both to Lindsay and myself and publicly that he would regulate it to 65 per cent,\" Mr Lew said. He says the bid does not require any other government help. \"At no time did we ever ask the Government for any grant or any cash payment or any dollars from taxpayers. \"What we asked for was for business from the Government, which will be forthcoming in our opinion, and an assurance  that there would be a trade practices review of the current airline situation.\" \n",

       "The storm clean-up in Sydney will resume in earnest this morning as fresh crews are brought in to replace State Emergency Service (SES) personnel who worked through the night. The storm hit Sydney early yesterday afternoon and two schoolgirls died when a tree fell on them at a reserve at Hornsby Heights in the city's north. A number of other people were injured as the storm brought down trees and power poles and lifted roofs. New South Wales Emergency Services Minister Bob Debus says welfare and emergency funding arrangements have been put in place with the declaration of natural disaster areas in Campbeltown, Hornsby, Warringah and Kurringai. \"Welfare services become available if they are needed, local government is refunded any money it spends on the clean-up or that it spends on repairing its own infrastructure. \"Low interest loans, if they are needed, are available to small business to help them get back on their feet again,\" Mr Debus said. Energy Australia says power has been restored to 35,000 customers and work will continue today to reconnect those still without electricity. Energy Australia's Peter Leete says work will concentrate around the worst hit areas. \"The worst of the problems we have still got are in Sydney's northern suburbs which seem to be the worst hit of all, and that's around Hornsby, St Ives, Turramurra and Frenches Forest,\" Mr Leete said. Four hundred SES volunteers are responding to more than 3,000 calls for assistance. The volunteers have worked throughout the night to remove trees from homes and roads. The SES' Laura Goodin says it will take several days before the damage is cleared up. \"While the SES has received fewer calls for help than in the storm two weeks ago, many of the jobs in this storm are actually quite complicated involving large trees or extensively damaged homes and businesses. \"We're estimating that most of the tasks will be completed by Friday if no new storms develop,\" Ms Goodin said. Outside Sydney, the storms caused damage in north-east of the state and the lower Hunter. Scores of homes and farm buildings have been damaged and literally hundreds of trees have been brought down. The storms, accompanied by gale force winds and hail, left large areas around Tamworth, Gunnedah and Quirindi without electricity and telephone services. \n",

On the first day of public hearings yesterday, royal commissioner Justice Neville Owen warned all parties not to break confidentiality agreements, following the possible leak of a report to the media last month. He told the commission one of the single biggest factors in the company's collapse was that it did not plan for future claims and did not have prudential margins over the estimate of future liabilities. He says all parties involved in the crash will have a chance to put their views. \"Of course fundamental principles of fairness require that before that stage of the inquiry is reached, any person whose interest might be adversely affected by a finding of a fact or a recommendation must be made clearly and unequivocally aware of that risk and be given ample opportunity to present any evidence and submissions relevant to that issue,\" he said. \n",
       "Around 1,000 people have braved the cold for a vigil in the hometown of former Beatle George Harrison, who died last week. \"Tonight we are gathered here in memory of George Harrison, a true son of Liverpool, whose music reached out to the whole world and shaped a generation,\"  Lord Mayor Gerry Scott said. Plans for a candlelight vigil had to be scrapped due to fierce northern winds, and Harrison was honoured instead by dozens of pictures of the guitar hero, who died of cancer at age 58. After a minute's silence the crowd heard a recording of \"My Sweet Lord,\" Harrison's biggest solo hit after the break-up of Liverpool's Fab Four, the most famous rock group in history. Harrison's family requested a second minute of silence to be held at 9:30pm local time. \"We felt we had to come tonight because losing George is like losing one of the family,\" said Elsie May, who joined the throng in paying tribute to the Beatle known as the Silent One. \"His music shaped our lives, and in the past we would take our children to see the Beatles when they were passing in a cavalcade. He was a wonderful man,\"  she said. Leanne McCormack, a university student, said: \"George was a talented musician and his music touched the lives of millions of people. \"I wanted to come here tonight to pay my respects because he was such a talented man. I feel lucky to have been staying in Liverpool when he died as it  has been really moving to see all the different memorials.\" Just before the ceremony, students from Harrison's school, Dovedales Juniors, planted a tree in his memory close to another tree planted two years ago in memory of John Lennon, another Beatle gunned down by a crazed fan in 1980. \n",

An Israeli military source said the soldiers shot four Palestinians near Jenin, when Palestinian gunmen opened fire on an army patrol and the troops returned fire. Another Palestinian was killed by Israeli soldiers near the West Bank city of Tulkarem, a Palestinian security source said. Meanwhile, Palestinian police have arrested three senior leaders of the hardline Hamas group in a crackdown that netted more than 75 Islamic militants following a wave of suicide attacks in Israel, a Palestinian security source told the AFP news agency. A Hamas official confirmed the arrests of two senior leaders, Ismail Abu Shanab and Ismail Haniya, and said police have issued arrest warrants for another two, but he refused to name them. The security source said more than 75 militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad were rounded after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian leadership vowed to crackdown on them for a wave of anti-Israeli suicide assaults. Most of the arrests came after the Palestinian leadership declared a state of emergency in the Palestinian territories giving police sweeping powers to round up militants. \n",

Pat Rafter was forced to withdraw from the match with a recurring arm injury just hours before he was to take the court. The deciding rubber was to be Rafter's farewell match before taking an indefinite break from the sport. Arthurs, who has not played a singles match since October, says he was bitterly disappointed to lose. \"Any tennis players dream to be out there in front of a partisan Australain crowd. You couldn't ask for anything more in your tennis career and I'm just unbelievably disappointed I didn't get the job done,\" he said.

I tell you anyone with less character wouldn't have lasted nearly as long. \"There was no guarantee he could play the doubles to start with, let alone the singles and if he had a day off there was still no guarantee.\" Rafter failed to show up to the post-match media conference. Team officals said he was tired, however Todd Woodbridge hit out at the media for wanting to ask him about his future plans. \"It's been [asked] 55 times every day for two and a half weeks, I mean what do you want him to say?\" he asked reporters. French team captain Guy Forget says the victory in part makes up for France's defeat against Australia in Nice two years ago. \"You're back in Australia against a better team on grass, against the number one player in the world and you pull off a win, it's very, very exciting and the way it happened is just very, very special,\" he said.

As the youngest Beatle, he had to be snuck in underage to venues prior to the band's phenomenal success in the early 1960s. He was responsible for some of the band's classic songs, such as Taxman, Here comes the Sun and Something. But up against the genius of Paul McCartney and John Lennon, his songs were hard-pressed to make it onto vinyl. Resentment built up and Harrison withdrew from the limelight. After the Beatles broke up he found solo success in 1971, with the track My Sweet Lord, although he was successfully sued for plagiarism and had to pay out half-a-million-pounds in damages. Always against a Beatles reformation, he famously declared in 1989 that the band would reform when Lennon was no longer dead. In later years he was beset by lung and throat cancer. He was lucky to survive a stabbing by an intruder in his UK home in 1999.

Virgin Blue has set up a temporary marquee terminal at Launceston airport after it was told by Ansett administrators that it could no longer share its terminal space. Virgin's deputy chief executive Rob Sherrard says the airline had an agreement with Ansett to use the check-in facilities for its lunchtime Launceston to Melbourne service but this could be terminated with seven days notice. Virgin was told last Thursday, it would have to move out throwing into disarray the airline's plans for second daily flight to Tasmania launched this morning. Mr Sherrard says he has not heard from the administrators since. \"Basically they were unwinding the contract that we had and we certainly were not able to access the terminal for our second daily flights to Launceston and of course Canberra as well,\" he said. \"That meant we had to make alternative arrangements.\" \n",
       "A team of Australian and Israeli scientists have conducted what they believe is successful research into using human embryo cells to repair brain damage. But their findings have been released just days after US president George W Bush criticised similar research by a team of Americans. Earlier this week Massachusetts based company Advance Cell Technologies said it had successfully cloned an early stage human embryo. The announcement sparked recriminations from US Congressmen with President Bush saying he was 100 per cent against any type of human cloning. Now an Australian-Israeli team has used excess IVF embryos to create precursor brain cells which they injected into the brains of baby mice. The findings show the brain cells grew to be indistinguishable from other brain tissue. While the research could prove useful in treating a variety of conditions including Parkinson's disease, it is likely to come under fire from human rights groups as it involves the destruction of human embryos. \n",
       "Today is World Aids Day and the latest figures show that 40 million people are living with HIV world-wide. The latest United Nations report on the AIDS epidemic has found Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union are becoming the new battleground in the fight against the disease. UN officials say in Russia the number of people carrying HIV doubles almost annually, while Ukraine has become the first nation in Europe to report 1 per cent of its adult population is HIV positive. The officials say a combination of economic insecurity, high unemployment and deteriorating health services are behind the steep rise. \n",
       "The Federal National Party has rejected a possible merger with the Liberals' at this stage, but it has not ruled out the option over the next three years. Liberal Party President Shane Stone is reported as saying amalgamation has to be considered as a strategy for the future of the Coalition. It comes as the two parties fight over numbers and muscle within the parliamentary groupings of the Coalition. National Party President Helen Dickie says merging the two parties is not necessary. \"I guess you cannot categorically rule out anything. There will be discussions by all states, but the states at this stage have led me to understand that certainly amalgamation for them is not an issue,\" she said. \n",
       "A University of Canberra academic's proposal for a republic will be one of five discussed at an historic conference, starting in Corowa today. The conference is part of Centenary of Federation celebrations and recognises the Corowa conference of 1893 which began the process towards the federation of Australia in 1901. University of Canberra law lecturer BedeHarris is proposing three referenda to determine the republic issue. They would decide on whether the monarchy should be replaced, the codification powers for a head of state and the choice of a republic model. Doctor Harris says any constitutional change must involve all Australians. \"I think it is very important that the people of Australia be given the opporunity to choose or be consulted at every stage of the process.\" \n",
       "Australia will take on France in the doubles rubber of the Davis Cup tennis final today with the tie levelled at 1-1. Wayne Arthurs and Todd Woodbridge are scheduled to lead Australia in the doubles against Cedric Pioline and Fabrice Santoro. However changes can be made to the line-up up to an hour before the match and Australian team captain John Fitzgerald suggested he might do just that. \"We'll make a team appraisal of the whole situation, go over the pros and cons and make a decision\" French team captain Guy Forget says he will not make changes but does not know what to expect from Australia. \"Todd is the best doubles player in the world right now so I expect him to play,\" he said. \"I would probably use Wayne Arthurs but I don't know what to expect really.\" Pat Rafter salvaged Australia's Davis Cup campaign yesterday with a win in the second singles match. Rafter overcame an arm injury to defeat French number one Sebastien Grosjean in three sets. The Australian says he is happy with his form. \"It's not very pretty tennis, there isn't too many consistent bounces, you are playing like I said a bit of a classic old grass court,\" Rafter said. Rafter levelled the score after Lleyton Hewitt's shock five set loss to Nicholas Escude in the first singles rubber. But Rafter says he felt no added pressure after Hewitt's defeat. \"I knew I had a good team to back me up even if we were down 2-0,\" he said. \"I knew I could win on the last day, I know the boys can win doubles, so even if we were down 2-0 I still feel we are a good enough team to win and vice-versa, they are good enough team to beat us as well.\""

So I think\\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\\natrocities.\\n\\tWhat is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\\ngo away.

In this case, the definition of the word \"create\"\\nis of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.\\n\\n\\n  I should have said \"given the Mormon belief.\"  If you disagree with the\\nMormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally\\nexistent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important\\npoint.\\n\\n\\n  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by\\nsuch terms.\\n\\n   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they\\nbelieve.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and\\nLucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or\\norganized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \"offspring\" of\\nGod has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \"born again\" of\\nHim.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.

You did not refer to the Mormon belief\\nthat Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie\\'s belief in same.  We\\nkeep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of\\nMormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)\\n\\n\\n  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie\\'s words as Mormon\\ncanon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*\\nimportance.

From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\\nthe final test.\\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\\nwouldn\\'t be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the\\nlove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we\\nare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But\\nthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only\\nthe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.\\nIt\\'s sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it\\nand who doesn\\'t. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don\\'t go to the\\nother place. But it is really much more than that...\\nThere are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the\\nlight and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nI don\\'t know, but I\\'m as willing to speculate as anyone.\\n\\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\\nstraightforward to me.)\\n\\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn\\'t quite fit into\\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.',\n",

       " u\"It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the\\ntradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.\\nAs the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\\nmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\\nfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\\nSince we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\\na predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\\nbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science\\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\\n\\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \\nrefered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \\nwould have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\\nto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\\n\\nRCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that\\nbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.

       " u'I will try to answer some of Dorin\\'s questions, even though they were\\nnot addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned\\nby the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is \\noften on the receiving end of Israel\\'s bombs.\\nIn the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied\\nLebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is \\ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n',\n",

Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same.

Just give me the cheapest\\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\\n\\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \\nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\\nbillion for the US share.\\n\\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\\nequipment would weigh?\\n\\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \\nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\\nengines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \\nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\\nDC-1.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.

       " u\"\\nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\\n\\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \\nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

Have you not read what the\\npurpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should\\nNOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do\\nnot follow Catholicism or any \"ism.\"  I follow Christ.\\n\\n\\nWhy would you want to live a good life?\\nTo you, you die and that\\'s it.  Don\\'t contradict yourself.  You have\\nno reason to live a good life.  It doesn\\'t do you any good in the\\nend.  Your life doesn\\'t do anybody else any good  either because\\neveryone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading\\na good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\\n\\n\\nHas the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.

It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?

The owners put out a statement few days ago, \\nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \\nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \\nshould.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  \\nAnd I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's \\na legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an \\ninformational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to \\nthe game.  So, I think it's good.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think they're moving fast enough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first \\nstep.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an \\nissue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to \\ngive it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \\nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \\non the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break \\nthat and get cloture?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I \\nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \\nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \\nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \\nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \\nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \\ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \\nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \\nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \\npressure not to do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \\nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \\neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \\nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \\nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \\nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \\na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \\nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \\nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \\nlevel, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they \\nhave chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep \\nAmericans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\n",

A6 \\n======================================================================   \\n\"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program\" AIDS \\nTreatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) \\n\\n     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \\nHealth has raised questions about the NIH\\'s commitment to an  effort that uses \\nunorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of \\nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \\nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \\nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \\navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \\nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \\nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \\neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \\nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \\nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \\nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \\ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists\\' \\ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \\nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \\npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \\nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \\nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \\nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \\nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It\\'s only fair to give the \\nOffice time to gel, but  it\\'s up to the public to insist that it\\'s much, much \\nmore [than  public relations].\" \\n======================================================================   \\n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \\nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \\n\\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\\n6 can attack the human immune system\\'s natural killer cells.  This attack \\ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \\nthe immune system\\'s fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \\nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.

Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \\nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso\\'s  \\nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \\nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \\nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \\nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \\nbody.  Lusso\\'s  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \\nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \\nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV\\'s attack.   Researchers concluded that \\nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \\n\\n    ======================================================================   \\n                                April 15, 1993 \\n     ====================================================================   \\n\\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \\nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \\nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \\n\\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \\nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \\nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \\nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \\nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \\nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley\\'s editorial on why American doctors  should care \\nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \\nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \\nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \\nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \\nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \\ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \\nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \\non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \\nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \\naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \\nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \\nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \\nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \\nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \\ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \\nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \\ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \\nchange the future of worldwide health. \\n====================================================================   \\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \\n\\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \\nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \\nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \\nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \\nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \\nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \\neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \\nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \\nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \\ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \\ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \\nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \\nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \\nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \\nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \\nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \\nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \\neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \\nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \\nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \\nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \\nhas been the rule.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n     ********************************************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n                                March 29, 1993\\n\\n\\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\\n\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \\nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \\n\\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \\nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide.

Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \\nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \\nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \\ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \\nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \\ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \\nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \\nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \\n\\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \\nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \\nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \\nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \\nDevelopment. \\n\\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \\nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \\nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \\n\\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \\nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \\ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \\nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\\'s division of AIDS.  \"We need this \\ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \\nHIV infection in children.\" \\n\\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \\nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \\n\\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \\npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \\na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \\nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \\ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \\nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \\n\\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \\nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \\ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \\ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \\nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \\nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \\n\\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \\nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \\nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \\nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \\nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \\n\\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \\nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \\nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \\nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID\\'s division of AIDS. \\n\\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \\nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \\nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We\\'ll also look at \\nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \\nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \\nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nproducts. \\n\\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \\nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \\nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \\n\\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \\nprotein  that gives rise to HIV\\'s surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \\nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \\nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \\nAdministration. \\n\\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \\nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \\nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \\nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \\ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \\nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \\n\\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \\nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \\nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \\nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \\nbe told what they receive. \\n\\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \\nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \\nbegin. \\n\\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \\nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \\n\\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \\nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \\np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \\nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals\\' \\nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \\nitself caused the skin disease. \\n\\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \\nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \\nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \\ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \\nRetroviruses. \\n\\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \\nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \\nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \\nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \\n\\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \\neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \\ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \\n\\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \\ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \\nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \\nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \\n\\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \\nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \\nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \\nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \\n\\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \\ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \\ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \\nanimals. \\n\\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \\npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \\non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \\n\\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \\nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \\ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals\\' immune \\nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \\nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \\n\\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \\nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \\ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \\nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \\ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \\nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \\n\\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \\nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \\nDiseases. \\n\\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \\nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \\nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \\nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n                 ********************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n\\n                                 March 4, 1993\\n\\n\\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \\nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \\nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \\ninfection or AIDS. \\n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \\nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \\ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \\nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \\nSan Francisco General Hospital. \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \\nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \\ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \\ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \\ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \\nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \\nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \\ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \\n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \\nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \\nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \\nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \\nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \\nanswered as quickly as possible. \\n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \\nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \\ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \\nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \\ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \\nsources of information or materials. \\n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \\nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \\npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \\ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \\nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \\nmedications, sex, age and the patient\\'s HIV history. \\n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \\nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA\\'s Bureau of Health \\nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \\nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \\n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \\ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \\nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \\nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \\n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \\nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA\\'s associate \\nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \\nDevelopment, G.

The system for the\\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\\nfor the other 40-bit key.\\n\\nSimilarly, it didn\\'t say \"We\\'re making encryption is commercially available.\"\\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\\n\\nThe next thing it didn\\'t say is \"We\\'re making encryption legal\",\\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\\nPresident can\\'t change the First Amendment merely by decree.\\nWhat it *did* say was:\\n\\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\\n\\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\\n\\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\\n\\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\\nwhich clearly means \"We\\'re making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\\nSoon.

I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \\nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \\nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \\nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \\nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \\nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \\ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \\nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \\nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \\ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \\nmy NeXT that way.\\n\\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \\nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\\n\\nI don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  \\npretty standard.\",\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

       " u'Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director\\n\\n                                GALILEO\\n                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT\\n                             POST-LAUNCH\\n                         April 9 - 15, 1993\\n\\nSPACECRAFT\\n\\n1.  On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC',\n",

       " u'Let me begin by saying I think this is the world\\'s first religion to use\\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \\ncommon.\\n\\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\\'s\\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nStory of Adam and Eve:\\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \\nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\\n\\nTraditional Philosophy:\\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\'s philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \\nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\\nlife for their children (and themselves).\\n\\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\\nEve\\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\\'s first good decision, instead\\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \\nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \\nuntil it was actively sought.\\n\\n---End serious discussion.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\\n\\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\\n\\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\\n\\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\\n\\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\\ndon\\'t. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\\n\\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\\nachieve a good result.\\n\\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\\n\\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he\\'s\\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\\n\\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\\nthought.\\n\\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\\n\\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\\n\\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph\\'s ten older brothers,\\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\\n\\n\\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\\n   and of Judaism.\\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\\n   the Promised Land.\\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\\n   of all humans everywhere.\\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\\n   saved them.\\n\\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity\\'s sake.]\\n\\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\\n   memorable line of the evening.\\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph\\'s brothers, and continuing\\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\\n   Epiphanes....\\n\\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren\\'t\\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\\nstate of Israel.\\n\\nSomeone hearing the rabbi\\'s lecture might leap to the conclusion\\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God\\'s doing -- that He\\nstirred up Joseph\\'s brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh\\'s\\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\\nbrought about.\\n\\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph\\'s brothers had not sold him, God\\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas\\' sin to redeem us. If\\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\\nand had attacked Fisher\\'s knight instead (don\\'t bother to look up\\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\\nnone the less valid).\\n\\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\\nwas not God\\'s doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God\\'s\\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\\n\\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\\nwill harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\\n\\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\\ninstruments of God\\'s will?\\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\\nJoseph\\'s brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\\npunishment.\\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.',\n",

He then said he needed  \\nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \\ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \\nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \\nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \\ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \\ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \\nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \\nthe turn of events.\\n\\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \\nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \\nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \\nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \\nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \\nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \\npretty steamed about the whole affair.

       " u'Hello src readers,\\n\\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\\nabout it a while ago. \\n\\n\\nThen OFM comments :\\n\\n\\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.',\n",

The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by \\n1/4, then 1/8 etc.\\n\\nAs for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct \\nlength for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the \\nwavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR \\nin using the middle channel of those you are going to use.\\nAnyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, \\nnowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not \\nmuch point in SWRing.

I came \\nhome from school at 12 o\\'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \\nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \\nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \\nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \\ncousin\\'s birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \\non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \\nthat I\\'d have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\\n\\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \\nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \\nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \\nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \\npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \\ntaken for Armenians.\\n\\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \\nbuilding where we knew there\\'d be a place to hide, but the whole road was \\npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \\nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people\\'s pockets and checking\\npassports. People who didn\\'t have passports with them were beaten as well.\\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\\n\\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn\\'t turn on any lights. We tried to call \\nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \\nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \\ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \\nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \\nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors\\' daughter said that that\\'s right, \\nthat\\'s what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \\nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn\\'t stay very \\nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \\nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \\nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \\nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \\nthere weren\\'t any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \\nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \\nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\\nAvakian was killed, too.\\n\\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \\nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn\\'t turn on the light. We \\nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\\ndecided she had already left.\\n\\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father\\'s\\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn\\'t want to give him our address,\\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\\n\\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \\nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \\ncould do. One of them took my parents\\' passports and began to read them. He \\nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \\ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \\npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \\nhad knives and steel truncheons.\\n\\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t use it. I just knew that if\\nI didn\\'t give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \\nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \\noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\\npush her so she\\'d walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \\nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \\nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\\n\\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \\nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \\nstrike me, and I\\'m knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \\nlose consciousness often . . . I don\\'t see or hear my parents, since I was the\\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \\ntheir balconies. That\\'s it. I try to pick them up, but can\\'t. My left arm is \\nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \\nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\\n\\nWe were attacked at around 9 o\\'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \\ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors\\' door, \\nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \\nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \\nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can\\'t see very far as a \\nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \\naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \\naway, and everything will be OK.\\n\\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \\no\\'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \\nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \\nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o\\'clock I and the other Armenians who are \\nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\\n\\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\\nbefore the 27th.\\n\\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \\nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \\nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \\nthat they were dead. My father\\'s older brother told me.\\n\\nMy father\\'s name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \\nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \\nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\\n\\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner\\'s report stated that their\\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\\n\\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \\nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \\nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \\nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn\\'t know the address.\\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \\nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \\ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \\nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \\ncalled from home, which also isn\\'t true. I heard noise and the sounds of \\nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \\nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \\nyears old. I don\\'t know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \\nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\\n\\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \\ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \\nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \\nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town\\'s construction. Mamma was from \\nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \\na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\\n\\n\\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \\nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\\n\\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \\nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\\n\\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\\n\\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\\n\\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \\nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \\nArmenia.\\n\\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\\ncan do that.\\n\\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \\nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\\n\\nYou can\\'t take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \\neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \\nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \\nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \\na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \\nin the hands of our government.\\n\\nJune 13,1988\\n\\nStepanakert \\n',\n",

This is\\n  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had\\n  any problems with it.\\n\\n  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than \\n  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better \\n  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non\\n  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.\\n  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear\\n  changes.\\n  \\n  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike\\n  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a\\n  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect\\n  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced \\n  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up\\n  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better\\n  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.\",\n",

Who would\\nhave thought?\\n\\n\\n\\tI remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5\\' a reasonable space\\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5\\' restriction, or the possibility\\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\\n\\n\\n\\tI disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much\\nmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word\\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\\n\\n\\n\\tThat seems to be the case already, given that heavy\\nweapons aren\\'t commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don\\'t think the superior\\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\\ntank I certainly wouldn\\'t ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\\n\\n\\n\\tThis I\\'ll agree with to a point.  The State having control\\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn\\'t so easy.  Otherwise,\\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\\n\\n\\n\\tI\\'m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\\nso one side doesn\\'t have all of them, I can\\'t see where this\\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\\n\\n\\n\\tWe have to assume that there would be those who would\\nside with the government-controlled forces, and if they\\'ve all\\nthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.\\nI\\'d like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the\\nlocal troups having a few 105\\'s and anti-tank weapons in their\\narmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the\\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\\nI suppose I\\'m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\tSo would I, but the resources often aren\\'t available to\\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\\nthan anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\\ntrucks, HumVee\\'s, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\\nother responses.  The Federal army, I\\'m convinced, should have a\\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\\nfor these functions.',\n",

Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

       " u'There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\\'s\\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......',\n",

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal\\nmanufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and\\nsubmachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the\\npolice and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police\\nhave stated that 40% (If I\\'m remembering the figure correctly) of\\nthe guns they conficate were illegally built.\\n\\n\\nIt takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one\\nof reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he\\'s going to have to \\npay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist\\'s\\ntime for something legal would run about $100.

That\\'s alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but\\nit works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction\\nin energy (so a .357 magnum would \"only\" be as deadly as a 9mm)\\nand it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer\\ncould just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the\\npolice (the police are often corruptable, and things are known\\nto disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and\\nreappear on the streets...)\\n\\n\\nPerhaps you weren\\'t watching the news two years ago, but the Serbs \\nalso tried to invade Slovinia.

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

And, again, the mating\\npractices need to be reexamined...\\n\\n\\nNo, but mating practices are a special case.  I\\'ll have to think about it\\nsome more.\\n\\n\\nIndeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems\\nare not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.

       " u\"After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to\\nadd.\\n\\n\\tFirst, most of the people I know who activly use encryption\\nprivately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,\\nand any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they\\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\\nafter all IS the bottom line. \\n\\n\\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \\nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \\n\\n\\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \\nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\\n\\n\\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \\nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \\n\\n\\n\\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \\nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\\n\\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \\nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\\ndegree.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tSincerly,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tTim Scanlon\\n\\n-- \",\n",
       " u'\\nAn interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by  \\nevangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his  \\ninterpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  \\ninterprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  \\nold U. S. of A.  That\\'s right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   \\nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \\nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \\nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \\nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn\\'t the whole world mourn?  The bible  \\nalso talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  \\nparaphrasing, of course).  Babylon\\'s sin affected, or should I say, infected,  \\nthe whole world.  It doesn\\'t take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  \\nstate of moral decay.  Hasn\\'t the American culture and Hollywood spread the \"do  \\nit if it feels good\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  \\nMr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  \\nBabylon \"Babylon the Great\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  \\nearth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  \\ndon\\'t think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  \\nmost powerful nation on earth.\\n\\nAgain, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  \\nof consideration.',\n",

       " u'Howdy,\\n\\nI\\'m a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the\\nknowledge and expertise available here.\\n\\nThe Subject:  After-market cruise controls\\n\\nThe Background:\\nI recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five \\nscrews, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn\\'t just the epitome of\\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\\n\\nMy question:\\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn\\'t going to\\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can\\'t expect much in the way of\\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything\\'s gotta be better than\\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\\n\\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y\\'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\\nelectronic.  Maybe you could\\'ve guessed it being an \\'84, but I\\'m just trying\\nto give information as completly as I can).\\n\\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \\ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\\n\\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \\nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I\\'m\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\\n\\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \\n\\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\\n\\t    the questions above)?\\n\\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\\ncars.  So the installation doesn\\'t scare me.  I just want to be certain that\\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\\n\\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don\\'t get over this group very often\\n(but I check my mail all the time).\\n\\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.',\n",

But these were\\nmiracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\\nhand!',\n",

       " u\"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\\n\\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\\ncan help a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

       " u\"Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \\npredict a player's RBIs using information about his overall\\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \\ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \\ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\\n\\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.

       " u': From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff)\\n: Message-ID: <1r24us$oeh@agate.berkeley.edu>\\n: It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications\\n: would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future\\n: probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.\\n\\nI think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court.\\nCurrently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record\\ncalls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants\\nand listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this\\nstrategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nNote that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\nget to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nAnd then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nAnd hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nAfter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\\ncompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \\nI can\\'t imagine why.\\n',\n",

Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \\nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \\n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \\n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \\n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and\\n reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between\\n SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.\\n\\nIBM\\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:\\n[...]\\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \\n drives.

Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\\n\\nSo at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES \\nthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode\\nit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.\\nThe problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put\\nrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT\\nthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the\\nSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}',\n",

That having been said, lets continue.\\n\\n   [snip]\\n   imagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\n\\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\\ncamps\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   Israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\n\\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe Lebanese gov\\'t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\\n\\nNo, the Syrian gov\\'t is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\\n\\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\\nThere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I\\ndid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over\\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\\n\\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\\n\\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\\nrefute the disciples\\' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\\nthe Baptist,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\\'s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\\'s \"The\\nEducation of the Human Race\".\\n\\nTo return to your original point, Paul\\'s statement about Jacob and\\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\\nChrist, in my view.',\n",

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is\\nalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)\\n\\nI\\'ve been working at this company for eight years in various\\nengineering jobs.  I\\'m female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\\non seven different occasions I\\'ve been sexually harrassed at this\\ncompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;\\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\\n\\nI\\'m really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\\n\\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\\n\\n\\t- someone\\'s idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\\n\\t- someone\\'s sick idea of flirting\\n\\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\\n\\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\\nme some kind of question, I don\\'t know the answer so I take a military\\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\\n\\nI can lock up my desk, but I can\\'t lock up every book I have in the\\noffice.  I can\\'t trust that someone won\\'t shove something into my\\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I\\'m not looking so that I go home to\\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\\nwants to do to my body.\\n\\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\\nleft in my desk drawer.\\n\\nI need some prayers --- I can\\'t stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\\nthat it\\'s ridiculous.\\n\\nI feel like I\\'m some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\\nlike I\\'m a sub-human piece of garbage that\\'s not worthy of a simple\\nphone call saying \"We\\'re leaving for Mary\\'s lunch a little early so\\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\"\\n\\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\\nisn\\'t tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\\ndo me no good when I\\'m terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\\n\\nAnd please pray that I don\\'t turn into an automaton because of this.\\nThat\\'s my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you\\'re not worth\\nanyone\\'s time so don\\'t go talking to anyone about this\", \"you\\'re right,\\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\\ncompany so why can\\'t others expect you to prostitute your body there as\\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren\\'t just possessions, and\\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don\\'t come into\\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\\n\\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn\\'t come between me and God.\\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\\nGod, and it\\'s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\\nseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn\\'t drop me from his\\nloving hand, but it\\'s awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the\\nhand, look down, think I\\'m falling and forget that God\\'s still holding\\non to me.)\\n\\nAlthough this probably isn\\'t entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,\\nI really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this\\nreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After\\nall, he\\'s allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall\\ntopics.\\n\\nThanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you,\\nEsther\\n',\n",
       " u'Note:     The following was released by the White House today in\\n          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip\\n          encryption technology.\\n\\n                           FACT SHEET\\n\\n                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT\\n\\nThe President has approved a directive on \"Public Encryption\\nManagement.\"  The directive provides for the following:\\n\\nAdvanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption\\nare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. \\nEncryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of\\ncommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. \\nAdvanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to\\nrapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. \\nThese advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the\\ninfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the\\ninformation age.\\n\\nDespite its benefits, new communications technology can also\\nfrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive. ',\n",

       " u'an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to\\n\"sport\" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets\\nthe switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does \"sport\"\\nmode entail?  several things:\\n\\n1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)\\n\\n2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there\\'s\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i\\'m sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n',\n",

       " u'I will again *repeat* my statement: 1) I *do not* condone these \\n*indiscriminate* Israeli acts (nor have I *ever*, 2) If the villagers do not know who these \"guerillas\" are (which you stated earlier), how do you expect the\\nIsraelis to know? It is **very** difficult to \"identify\" who they are (this\\n*is why* the \"guerillas\" prefer to lose themselves in the general population \\nby dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).\\nI agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these\\nattacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its\\nsituation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control\\nthis \"third party state\" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept\\noccuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do\\nsomething ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?\\nIt is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside\\nparty to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angola\\nhad the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn\\'t) stop anti-Angolan\\nguerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africa\\nrefused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola,\\nwould Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying that\\nAngola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?\\nI refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from\\nLebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. \\n\\nOne hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its \\nborder but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS \\nCHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the \\nLebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it \\nEASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That\\n**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*\\nhave been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions. \\nI fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be \"used\" by EITHER side,\\nand have been (and continue to be). But the most fundamental issue is that\\nif a state cannot control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so, it\\nshould expect others to do it for them. Hopefully that \"other\" will be\\nthe UN but it is (as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia) weak.',\n",

       " u'\\nPerhaps you\\'re using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have\\na hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their\\n(excellent) gear).\\n\\nOne of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is\\nwhether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature\\nis to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock\\nthe instrument into real time capture mode.\\n\\n\\nI agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are\\n_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.\\nHowever, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)\\nseem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or\\nmore knobs required of a \"real\" scope :-)\\n\\n\\nThis is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated\\nthe latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy\\nalternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has\\na 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time\\ncapture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in\\nthe range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at\\nleast they appear to be logically laid out.\\n\\nOne more thing about the new, \"simpler\", front panels. These instruments\\ntend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement\\nover the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our\\nscopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these\\nswitches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the\\nlongevity of the instruments.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n',\n",

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry\\nhappens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I\\nalways understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I\\nunderstand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who\\nhappen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or\\nother inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen\\nindicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are\\nexactly such inconsequential characteristics.

       " u'\\nStop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \\nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \\nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes? I\\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\\'m not going to waste my time\\ntrying to debunk someone\\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\\n\\n\\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\\n\\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \\nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \\nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \\nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\\n\\nI\\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

       " u'\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\\n\\nMAGI: \\n\\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.',\n",

       " u\"A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\\nearth:\\n\\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\\n\\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\\n\\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\\n\\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\\ncross, would want to share in his death.\",\n",

It\\'s possible\\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.

The 27th was a short day at\\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \\ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn\\'t have anything on her head, and \\nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They\\'re 40 to \\n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\\n\\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn\\'t see what it was, \\nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \\nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\\naround it. I ask, \"What\\'s going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\\ndidn\\'t understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \\nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \\nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There\\'s\\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \\nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \\nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\\n\\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \\nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \\nthings, but I didn\\'t have any idea what was really going on.\\n\\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt\\'s house in Baku. \\nI didn\\'t say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\\no\\'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \\nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \\ndemonstration and move slowly.\\n\\nMy wife asks what\\'s going on out there. I say I don\\'t know. I put on some\\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \\non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \\nand went against the traffic--it\\'s one way there--down the Street of the 26 \\nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \\nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \\nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \\nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\\n\\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\\nuneasy and said, \"No, let\\'s stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \\nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn\\'t keeping track of the time, I can\\'t say\\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\\n\\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There\\'s noise, an uproar outside,\\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \\nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \\naggressive. No, I think, something\\'s wrong here, this isn\\'t any demonstration.\\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \\nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \\nfollowed them. I was thinking I\\'d just watch and see. Who knew where this was \\nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \\nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \\nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \\nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don\\'t need \\nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \\nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \\nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \\nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \\nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I\\'ve never seen it \\nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\\n\\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians\\' \\napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn\\'t \\nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \\ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \\nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn\\'t see any of them try \\nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\\n\\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\\n\\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\\nlor\\'s shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \\nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \\nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \\ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \\nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \\noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \\nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \\nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \\nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \\nhas a package in his hand, and he\\'s pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \\nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I\\'ve seen a lot of \\npeople smoke it, I\\'ve seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \\naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\\n\\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \\nI turned around and saw them running. Well I\\'ll just keep on going like I am, \\nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \\nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \\nstreet. He\\'s a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \\nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \\nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don\\'t really\\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father\\'s name is\\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \\nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \\nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \\ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \\nleft. Now Rafik\\'s little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \\nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \\nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \\nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \\ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\\n\\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It\\'s OK, it\\'ll pass, \\nthey\\'re young kids, they\\'ve just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn\\'t \\nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \\nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn\\'t \\nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine\\'s in motion. They weren\\'t \\nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn\\'t see people drinking \\nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn\\'t unloaded the vodka and \\nhashish to put in a store window!\\n\\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \\nwould stop them now, they weren\\'t even trying, although, I\\'ll say it again, \\nthe police were there, I saw them. And it\\'s not just that the police weren\\'t \\nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \\nTrue, at the time I couldn\\'t even imagine that under our government, our much-\\nvaunted leadership--and I\\'m not afraid to say these words: so many people \\ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \\ncouldn\\'t imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \\nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \\nSumgait, I couldn\\'t imagine that such things could take place.\\n\\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let\\'s go upstairs.\" \\nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \\nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \\nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \\nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \\nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \\ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \\nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \\nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \\nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\\n\\nWe spent the night at the neighbors\\'. My apartment was on the first floor,\\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\\n\\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \\nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \\nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \\nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \\nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\\nyou couldn\\'t even see him.\\n\\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

       " u'I produced an error last week about CHORION:\\n\\n\\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler',\n",

To come up\\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by\\npersonality type summary file.\\n\\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.\\n\\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\\npreferences have their place in the Body).\\n\\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\\nexcerpted from my summary:\\n\\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\\n\\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\\n                          world of people, activities or things.\\n\\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\\n\\n\\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\\nto fit them into a particular framework.

Also, she has been preparing the new \\nEden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.',\n",

Hope you can join us.\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \\nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \\nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\\n\\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \\ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \\ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \\nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \\nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \\nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \\nlifetime.  \\n\\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \\nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \\nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \\nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \\nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \\nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\\n\\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \\nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \\nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \\nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \\nFoundation's mission is to change that. \\n\\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \\nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

       " u'Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\\n\\n BACKGROUND\\n ----------\\n\\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \\n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe.

       " u'By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\\n\\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\\n\\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\\nWith the North Stars\\' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"',\n",

I haven\\'t been able to find any obvious \\nplaces where they screwed up.\\n\\n\\nHmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by\\nyour dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \"credit card\" key that \\ncame in the owner\\'s binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key\\ndoesn\\'t have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won\\'t count it. :-))\\n\\n\\nThe latter is probably because of the air bag.  It\\'s pretty much takes up\\nall the space where you\\'d expect to find the horn.\\n\\nSpeaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one\\nof those nice \\'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.\\nThe previous Probes had Japanese horns.\\n\\n\\nYeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.\\n\\n\\nI agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The\\ninterior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically\\nsound.\\n\\n...\\n\\nYes, this car\\'s stiff suspension isn\\'t for everyone.  I personally like it,\\nbut if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I\\'d strongly\\nsuggest looking into the MX-6.\\n\\n\\nThe problem with the back seat is that there\\'s no leg room.  Plenty of \\nhead room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,\\nso long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to \\ngive them a place to put their feet.\\n\\n\\nThe power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)\\nI really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I\\'ve always been a sucker\\nfor open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!\\n\\n\\nI haven\\'t heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes\\n(\\'89 and maybe \\'90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which\\nFord will replace at no charge), but I haven\\'t heard about anything like\\nthis concerning the \\'93 Probes.\\n\\nI haven\\'t had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot\\nthat was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even\\ngave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my\\ncar.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering\\nthat I was expecting the worst from them!\\n\\nFrom what I\\'ve heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with \\nthe Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but \\nI think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That\\'s\\nalmost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\n-chuck-',\n",

       " u'\\n\\n\\n# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don\\'t agree\\n# with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.\\n\\n\\n\\n# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the\\n# Holy Qur\\'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual\\n# and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical\\n# descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally\\n# and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition\\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\\n\\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\\n     the same way?\\n\\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\\n# FLATLAND (if you haven\\'t already) or THE DRAGON\\'S EGG.  The first\\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\\n# cept...\\n\\n[some deleted for space saving]\\n\\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\\n# necessary.  The \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference`\\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \\n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\\n\\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\\n\\n\\nStephen\\n\\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n',\n",

This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.

So...the easiest way to get away with attacking\\nanother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects\\ninnocent lives?\\n\\n\\nYour damn right Israel insists on some sort of \"demilitarized\" or \"buffer\"\\nzone.

It is not exactly\\nsurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to \\ndo it themselves.\\n\\n\\nWhat? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \\ncan start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will\\nonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the \\nresponsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their \\nsoil.

Words *can be taken\\nback* by merely doing so; to \"take back\" tangible items (land,\\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\\nstay away from.\\n \\nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \\nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \\nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \\ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \\nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \\ncommitted by \"private groups\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \\nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\\ndon\\'t be so idiotic as to suggest \"trust\" for the motivations of\\npresent-day Arab states)?\\n\\nAh, ok...what is \"different\" about the present situation that tells\\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \\npolicies towards Israel? Now, don\\'t talk about vague \"political factors\"\\nbut about those \"tangible\" (just like that which Israel gave up)\\nfactors that \"guarantee\" the responsibility of those states.

       " u'Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for\\nWindows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia\\'s\\nMS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some\\nsites in the U.S.  The three I found were:\\n\\n1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)\\n                                This was the smallest and simplest\\n   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.\\n   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra\\n   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the\\n   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press\\n   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would\\n   have been nice if there was an \"ALWAYS ON TOP\" setting for the little\\n   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified\\n   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be\\n   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace\\n   manager makes it an attractive package.\\n\\n2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)\\n                               While this workspace manager offered a\\n   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming\\n   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace\\n   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \"snapshots\"\\n   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what \\n   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,\\n   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.\\n   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in\\n   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this\\n   viewing functionality which is quite useful.\\n\\n3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)\\n                            This is an interesting package, which contains\\n   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies\\n   include \"Backmenu\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you\\n   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu\\n   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,\\n   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could\\n   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also\\n   bundled in \"backdesk.zip\" is a program called \"WRUN\", which allows\\n   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS\\n   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  \\n   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite\\n   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it\\n   doesn\\'t provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.\\n   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,\\n   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to\\n   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different\\n   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which\\n   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window\\n   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically\\n   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area\\n   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up\\n   of a particular section.',\n",

Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of \\n Transcaucasia).\\n\\nIn 1920, \\'0\\' percent Turk. \\n\\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \\n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \\n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \\n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \\n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \\n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \\n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \\n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \\n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \\n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \\n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \\n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \\n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \\n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \\n scattered bones of the dead.\" \\n\\n                             Ohanus Appressian\\n                            \"Men Are Like That\"\\n                                   p. 202.\\n\\n\\n \"In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.\\n  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us\\n  create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial\\n  life-support system of an imagined \\'ethnic purity\\' that some of us\\n  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats \\n  in this alien land.\"\\n            (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - \"Preserving the Armenian purity\") \\n\\n\\n<1993Apr24.042427.29323@walter.bellcore.com>\\nddc@nyquist.bellcore.com (Daniel Dusan Chukurov 21324)\\n\\n\\nNo kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire\\'s eastern provinces,\\nmassacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly \\npeople, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated \\nthe entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between \\n1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today \\nin Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide \\nthat is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought \\nthey could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the \\nRussian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian \\nterror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle \\nresorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent\\nTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that \\nthey are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ntoday.\\n\\nA merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri \\ntown of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to \\nhave taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military \\noperation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the \\nArmenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been \\nmassacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten \\nand shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed \\nthe Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian \\ninsurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the\\nKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City \\nhospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant \\nwere killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to \\ncondemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its \\nsovereignty.\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n",

       " u'Hi there,\\n\\nI\\'ve made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally\\nwrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone\\nhere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but\\nare missing some higher-level functionality.  They\\'re intended more as an\\nintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.\\n\\n*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it\\n*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I\\'ll make the mods and re-post it as a\\n*** different version.\\n\\nThe routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They\\nare fairly simple, but I\\'ve found them to be very fast (for my purposes,\\nanyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a\\n\"virtual screen\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with\\nno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy\\nareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I\\'ve also included a\\nsimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256\\ncolor GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick\\'n\\'dirty(tm) demo program\\nthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three \"windows\".\\n\\nThe whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip \\nIt is zipped with pkzip 2.04g\\n\\nIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I\\'m concerned.

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tferkel.ucsb.edu\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\\n\\t\\tstasi.bradley.edu\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/ISC\\n\\t\\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\\n\\t\\ttsx-11.mit.edu\\t\\t\\t- Linux binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\\n\\t\\tagate.berkeley.edu\\t\\t- 386BSD binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\\n\\t\\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\\t\\t\\t- Mach binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /i386\\n\\n\\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\\n\\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

       " u'\\n\\nThe argument for Luke\\'s genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary\\'s genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband\\'s, from David\\'s son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David\\'s\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus\\'s physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus\\'s messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus\\'s divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph\\'s seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel\\'s dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner\\'s \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner\\'s methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one\\'s Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary\\'s\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.',\n",

If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\\nIMPOSSIBLE.

That said, please\\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\\n\\n\\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n\\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...

The price could be hell to pay, later.\\n\\n\\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\nbecause we have this \\'crisis\\' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n\\'drastic action\\', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don\\'t buy into it.\\n\\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\nisolated \\'respected experts\\' (respected by whom?  for what?

How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a \\'master key\\' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.

I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\nConstitution.  It has to stop.

       " u\"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid\\nrockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on\\na reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid\\nmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of \\naluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent\\nAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.\\nThe structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect\\nsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made\\na bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what\\nyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in\\nall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into\\nthe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.

The name \\nof Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's\\nPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo\\nof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo.

What makes Greeks\\nso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable\\ndemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,\\nfor instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in\\n1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New \\nWorld, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence\\nin 1776 will come 284 years later.\\n\\nShouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for \\n'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city?

Greek\\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\\n\\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

       " u'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \\n\\n\\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\\n\\n\\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\\n\\n\\nThe Prophet\\'s first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\\nProphet\\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\\n\\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.',\n",

This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, \\nthe intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass \\ngraves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed \\nwhat fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.\\n\\nThe problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of \\noppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot \\nofficials and their violation of the co-founder status of \\nthe Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d\\'etat \\nengineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution \\nto the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked \\nTurkiye\\'s intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and \\nonly as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues \\nconsulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories \\nto the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply \\nwas not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at \\nall. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which \\nwas openly expansionist, stated as \\'Enosis,\\' union with Greece. \\nSince the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish \\npopulation, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder\\nof the republic with the Greek population.\\n\\nThe Greek Cypriots, with the support of \\'Enosis\\'-minded\\nGreeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that\\nstatus and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with\\na minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are\\nnot a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the\\nonly way they could show that was to assert their \\nautonomy in a separate republic.\\n\\nTurkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would\\nrather not be involved with the island. But, given the\\ndismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish\\npopulation in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate\\nof the island\\'s Turks in the hands of the Greeks until\\nthe Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord\\nthe two communities finally reach to guarantee that\\nhistory will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots\\nof their rights, liberties and their very lives.\\n\\n\\n  Source: \\'Cyprus: The Tale Of An Island,\\' A.

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I\\nown both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to \\nbuild up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have\\nheard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic.\\nSince you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/\\nhome use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I \\nhave found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily:\\nI have one database where the order in which the records are entered must \\nbe different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to \\nuse the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records \\nappropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)\\nexporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach \\ndatabase), and then copying the exported files back to the original \\nfilename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really \\nlike about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than \\nthe loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also \\ntakes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).',\n",

       " u'\\nThe third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than\\nApple\\'s. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\\nDESTAs (DEC\\'s oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\\n\\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\\n\\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won\\'t add\\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\\n    As for Thicknet, it\\'s a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\\n\\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won\\'t run on System 7.1).\\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don\\'t use earlier versions on a Centris).\\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\\n      self-terminated or not.\\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\\n\\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\\n      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable\\n      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).\\n    - get a 25ohm terminator.\\n\\nYour two-machine network will look like this:\\n\\n\\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\\n      +-----+                                           |\\n      |     |                                           |\\n      +-----+                                         +-----+\\n                                                      |     |\\n                                                      +-----+\\n    DECstation                                        Centris\\n     5000/200                                           650\\n                              OR\\n\\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\\n        {=}                                             |\\n      +-----+                                           |\\n      |     |                                         +-----+\\n      +-----+                                         |     |\\n                                                      +-----+\\n    DECstation                                        Centris\\n5000/25,125,133,240                                     650\\n         \\n   ##    -> 25ohm terminator\\n   T     -> T connector\\n   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)\\n   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter\\n   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)\\n   |\\n   |\\n\\nAndy',\n",

       " u'\\n[...]\\n\\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\\n\\n   [Reproduced without permission]\\n\\n\\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\\n\\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\\n\\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\\n\\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\\n\\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\\n\\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\\n\\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\\n\\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\\n\\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\\n\\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\\n\\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\\n\\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\\n\\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\n\\tThe word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \"B\"\\nword, or the \"H\" word, or even the \"N\" or \"W\" words. It is the \"L\" word -\\nLOSER !!\\n\\n\\tThat\\'s right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\\n\\n\\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\\n(wouldn\\'t you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya\\', the God Augustus never had\\nit so good. \\n\\n\\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\\ndoesn\\'t deserve one\\'s bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\\ndiscourse about people who \"don\\'t get it\". For those of us in the winning\\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \\nsuggestion of losing.\\n\\n\\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \\n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \\nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind \\'three\\nyards and a cloud of dust\\' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \\nweapon of choice these days. \\n\\t\\n\\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \\nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \\nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \\nsure does look natural on Mike doesn\\'t it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \\nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \\ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\\n\\n\\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \\nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \\nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \\n\\n\\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \\n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \\nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \\nminority.\\n\\n\\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn\\'t care\\nwho\\'s winning and who\\'s losing. In some cases, you might say something\\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \\n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\\nthe pot.\\n\\n\\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you\\'ll still\\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \\nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I\\'d like to \\nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \\npreference, and sexual orientation.
